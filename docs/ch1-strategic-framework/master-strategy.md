# Master Strategy Plan

## B - Base goal
Create a master strategy plan suitable for a ~2‑hour boardroom presentation (near-term quick hits + 5‑year growth), focused on diversifying beyond multifamily in Wisconsin while staying open‑shop.

# REVIEW_LEGACY:
- `LaBrant_WI_Diversification_Strategy.md` overlaps with this boardroom package. After the board meeting, choose one file to be the "single source of truth" and archive the other.

## Boardroom session agenda (120 minutes)
1. **Context + constraints (10 min)** -- confirm guardrails and success definition.
2. **Market signals (25 min)** -- where demand is moving in WI; what that means for open‑shop painters.
3. **Competition (20 min)** -- low-bid volume cycles and bundled trades; what to stop doing.
4. **Strategy (30 min)** -- segments + geographies + plays (Year 1 and Year 5).
5. **Capabilities + resourcing (20 min)** -- people, process, tools, credibility.
6. **KPIs + risks + 90‑day plan (15 min)** -- commit owners and dates.

**Deliverable:** a signed decision log + 90‑day sprint charter.

## Decision log (what the room must decide)
1. **Year‑1 segment focus (pick 2 primary + 1 opportunistic lane):**
   - A) Owner‑direct exterior repaints (hotels, condos/HOAs, mid-rise exteriors)
   - B) Light industrial maintenance & coatings (warehouses, manufacturing, F&B)
   - C) Senior living + private clinics (private, recurring refresh)
   - D) Select municipal/county facilities (only when specs don't force union routes)

2. **Geography tiers (commit footprint):**
   - **Tier 1:** Milwaukee Metro + Madison/Dane (depth + repeatability)
   - **Tier 2:** Fox Valley + Green Bay (industrial/commercial growth, controlled travel)
   - **Tier 3:** North/West incl. Superior (only for high-value specialty / owner-direct)

3. **Capacity allocation rule:**
   - Set a **minimum weekly crew allocation** reserved for diversification work so it actually happens (without starving multifamily).

---

## Guardrails (non‑negotiables)
- **Open-shop first.** Avoid union‑dominant pipelines by default.
- **Wisconsin only.** No Illinois or Minnesota expansion.
- **Private is preferred.** Owners, developers, property managers, facility managers, open‑shop GCs.
- **Multifamily remains the foundation** for the next decade; diversification stacks on top.

---

## Strategy summary
### Year 1 (quick hits)
**Objective:** add repeatable, owner-direct work that reduces exposure to multifamily price wars.

**Primary plays (recommended):**
1. **Owner-direct repaint program** (portfolio agreements):
   - Hotels, HOAs/condos, property managers, light commercial portfolios.
   - Lead with "certainty": schedule window + safety plan + closeout package.

2. **Light industrial maintenance accounts**:
   - Warehouses, manufacturing, F&B plants; sell shutdown readiness and coatings competence.
   - Target recurring outage windows and maintenance budgets.

**Opportunistic lane (only if scorecard passes):** senior living + private clinics (private, recurring refresh cycles).

### Year 2-5 (becoming a larger player)
**Objective:** become "the default repaint + coatings partner" for portfolios and facilities.

- Build **program agreements** (annual/portfolio) with 10-15 anchor accounts.
- Expand multifamily reach into Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets (Madison + Fox Valley) to keep the base resilient.
- Invest selectively in exterior/high-access capabilities where ROI is clear.

---

## Competitive response plan (what to do differently)
### 1) Volume low-bid cycles (e.g., Craftmaster)
- **Don't chase the price floor.** Hold a minimum margin rule.
- **Change the evaluation:** schedule certainty, QA documentation, change-order discipline, "no-surprises" closeout.
- **Bid less, sell more:** focus negotiated or semi-negotiated paths where possible.

### 2) Bundled drywall/paint (e.g., States + Suburban paint divisions)
- Treat as **structural pricing pressure** on new-build interiors.
- Counter with:
  - **Owner-direct** work (repaints and programs)
  - **Specialty scopes** (coatings, exterior systems, shutdown work)
  - **Partner when it's strategic** (when drywall is already locked and they want a specialist painter).

### 3) Exterior specialists (e.g., Dublin benchmark)
- Decide what to emulate (access planning, safety documentation, equipment strategy).
- Don't copy everything; copy **the profitable parts**.

### 4) Union signatories (avoid by default)
- Treat union-GC institutional work as a **default "no"** unless owner-direct carve-out economics are exceptional.

---

## Go-to-market operating system (simple + repeatable)
1. **Target list (Top 60):** 20 owners/developers, 20 property managers/HOA managers, 20 facility/plant managers (split by segment + geography).
2. **Warm intros first:** each anchor relationship yields 2 referrals.
3. **Productized offers:** exterior refresh, shutdown paint, unit-turn program.
4. **Proof package:** 2 case studies (Hyatt exterior + industrial/coatings example), safety plan narrative, references.
5. **Bid gate:** if it fails the gate, you pass.

---

## Capabilities roadmap (what to build)
### People
- Assign an **Account Captain** per chosen segment.
- Identify a **coatings lead** (spec review + crew training).

### Process
- Weekly **CO review cadence** (capture rate as a KPI).
- Standard scope templates by segment.

### Tools/Equipment
- Exterior access plan (rent -> own decision rules).
- Containment/surface prep equipment as needed for coatings.

### Credibility
- Case studies and closeout packages.
- Safety narrative + jobsite documentation standards.

---

## KPI dashboard (leading indicators)
- Targets touched/week (by segment)
- Qualified opportunities in pipeline
- Proposal-to-award cycle time
- % negotiated vs hard-bid
- Win rate by segment
- CO capture rate
- Schedule adherence
- Rework/defect incidents

---

## 90-day sprint charter (owners + dates)
- **Weeks 1-2:** lock segments + tiers; define crew allocation rule; define bid gate.
- **Weeks 2-4:** build Top‑60 list; create 3 offers; produce 2 case studies.
- **Weeks 4-6:** outreach cadence; schedule 12 relationship meetings; bid only gated work.
- **Weeks 6-10:** win 1-2 pilot projects; push for program/portfolio conversation.
- **Weeks 10-12:** KPI review; refine templates; lock next-quarter pipeline.

---

## Validation scenarios (to keep the plan honest)
### Segment A -- Owner-direct exterior repaints
**Scenario:** 10 target hotels/HOAs in Tier 1; 20 intros; 6 site walks.
- Expected: 2 proposals accepted within 90 days; at least 1 converts to a repeat-cycle agreement.

### Segment B -- Light industrial maintenance & coatings
**Scenario:** 15 plants/warehouses; 10 facility manager meetings; 3 shutdown window bids.
- Expected: 1 pilot shutdown job awarded; coatings spec compliance documented; margin meets minimum rule.

### Segment C -- Senior living + private clinics (opportunistic)
**Scenario:** 12 decision-maker meetings; 4 refresh bids.
- Expected: 1 award with short award cycle (≤30 days) and low admin burden.

### Competitive defense -- low-bid volume cycle
**Scenario:** competitor undercuts by 10-15% on a multifamily interior.
- Expected: you **decline or reframe** (alternate scope, schedule premium) unless margin rule holds.

## Provenance (files + section tags)
- `LaBrant_Master_Strategy_Deck.pptx` -- generated from `labrant_master_strategy_deck.js` (sections 1A-9A in slide notes).
- `LaBrant_Master_Strategy_Plan.md` -- this document (sections align to deck flow).

Assumptions: Multifamily remains the base workload; you have (or can assign) two sales/account-capable leaders; you can pursue owner-direct private work statewide; you maintain an intentional "avoid union pipeline" posture except for rare owner-direct carve-outs.
