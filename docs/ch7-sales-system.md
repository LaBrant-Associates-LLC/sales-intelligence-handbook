## GC Relationship Tiers

| Commonwealth | $296K | 59% | Very profitable |

### Tier 2: Growth Targets (20-35%)

| GC | Revenue | Net Margin |

| Nicholas & Associates | $1.58M | 34% |
| Cardinal Capital | $1.50M | 35% |
| TWG | $367K | 29% |

| KCG | $468K | 17% | Thin margin |
| Horizon (HCG) | $687K | 16% | Large volume, pricing issue |
| Peridot CM | $244K | 10% | 9 jobs, low margin |
| TAE & Associates | $442K | 5% | Barely profitable |

**Action:** Schedule pricing discussions. Target minimum 25% net margin.

### Tier 4: Avoid (Loss History)

| GC | Loss | Issue |
|----|------|-------|
| LB West | -$63K | Out-of-state AZ job |
| CG Schmidt | -$58K | Union signatory |
| CL1 Properties | -$47K | Multiple Hyatt losses |
| Corliss | -$243K | Major cost overruns |

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. Out-of-State Projects Losing Money

Both Arizona projects are losses:
- Libertad (AZ): $509K revenue, -$44K loss
- Vista Winds (AZ): $470K revenue, -$63K loss

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue out-of-state work. Travel, coordination, and unfamiliarity destroy margins.

### 2. Data Quality Issues

| Entry | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| SPLIT | -$698K -- Cost allocation bucket, needs QB cleanup |
| Corliss | -$243K -- Billing vs. cost mismatch |
| Stevens | -$115K -- Unbilled work or data entry error |

**Total questionable losses:** ~$1,057,000

### 3. Hyatt Jobs Combined Loss

| Job | GC | Net |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Hyatt Lobby | Peridot | +$30K (65%) |
| Hyatt Ballrooms | Peridot | -$40K (-65%) |
| Hyatt Exterior | CL1 | -$40K (-28%) |
| **Total** | | **-$50K** |

**Lesson:** Large renovation scopes at existing hotels have hidden conditions. Add discovery allowance and operations premium.

- Horizon: Need 25%+ to make sense
- TAE: 5.4% margin likely estimating errors

**Evaluate Subcontractor Mix:**
- Identify top 5 subs by spend
- Analyze which work could be in-house
- Target 50% internal labor (from current 30%)
