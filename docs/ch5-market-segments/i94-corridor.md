## Speculative Building Inventory

### What Is Spec Development?

Developers build warehouses **without tenants committed**, betting on market demand. This creates:

1. **Initial painting** during construction
2. **Tenant improvement painting** when leases signed
3. **Ongoing maintenance** after occupancy

### Current Spec Pipeline (Estimated)

| Status | Square Feet | Opportunity Phase |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Under construction | 2-3 million SF | New construction now |
| Recently completed (vacant) | 1-2 million SF | TI painting imminent |
| Planned/announced | 3-5 million SF | Future pipeline |

### Tenant Improvement (TI) Opportunities

**When Spec Buildings Lease:**

| TI Component | Painting Scope |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Office build-out** | Walls, ceilings, trim |
| **Warehouse demising** | Separation walls |
| **Loading dock areas** | Safety striping, walls |
| **Break rooms** | Full interior |
| **Restrooms** | Specialty coatings |
| **Exterior signage areas** | Accent painting |

**Typical TI Painting Budget:**
- Small tenant (50,000 SF): $15,000-$30,000
- Medium tenant (150,000 SF): $40,000-$80,000
- Large tenant (300,000+ SF): $75,000-$150,000+
