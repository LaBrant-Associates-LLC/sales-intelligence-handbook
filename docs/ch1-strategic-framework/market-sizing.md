# Market Sizing

## Context

This page assumes the definitions and scope established in [Chapter 1: Strategy](index.md). It does not restate tier systems, market definitions, or global guardrails.

## Wisconsin Construction Baseline

Wisconsin's construction market provides the macro context for segment-level planning. Total value of construction in Wisconsin reached approximately $19.2 billion in 2024, driven primarily by growth in non-residential sectors including office and data center development (not all of which are strategic fits for LaBrant). Private nonresidential spending accounted for approximately $7 billion, with state and local spending contributing another $7 billion.

Residential permits in 2024 totaled 23,727 units, split roughly 54% single-family and 46% multifamily. This multifamily volume directly feeds the new-build painting pipeline while the existing stock drives the repaint and maintenance market.

## Market Sizing Model

For strategy decisions, the relevant market is dollars that owners and GCs spend on painting and industrial protective coatings across multifamily, private nonresidential, industrial maintenance, and select municipal work where union and prevailing-wage friction is manageable.

### New Construction and Major Renovation

1. **Private nonresidential paint scope.** Based on $7 billion in private nonresidential spend and a typical paint scope range of 1.5–2.5% of project value, the implied annual paint scope is $105–175 million.

2. **Multifamily new paint scope.** Based on approximately 10,900 multifamily units permitted in 2024 and an interior paint range of $2,500–5,000 per unit plus 20–40% uplift for common areas and exteriors, the implied annual scope is $32–77 million.

3. **Combined new and major renovation.** Planning range for private nonresidential plus multifamily is approximately $140–250 million annually.

### Repaint and Maintenance

Repaint and maintenance volume is often comparable to or greater than new-build volume because interiors cycle every 5–7 years, exteriors cycle every 7–12 years, and industrial assets require ongoing corrosion control. A reasonable planning factor places repaint and maintenance at 1.0–2.5 times new-build scope, yielding an implied range of $140–625 million.

### Total Addressable Market

Planning TAM for commercial, multifamily, and industrial coatings in Wisconsin is approximately $280–875 million per year. The lower end reflects conservative repaint factors and paint scope percentages. The upper end reflects a maintenance-heavy environment.

### Serviceable Addressable Market

Converting TAM to SAM requires discounting for union-only projects, prevailing wage friction, and scopes packaged with drywall where pricing is structurally compressed. A reasonable planning assumption places SAM at 40–70% of TAM, yielding a range of approximately $110–610 million per year.

## Segment Opportunity Map

These ranges are slices of the TAM above, not additive. Use them to prioritize segments by size, union friction, margin potential, and repeatability.

| Segment | Scope Sold | Union Friction | Planning Size (WI) | Strategic Value |
|---------|------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Multifamily turns and repositioning | Unit turns, corridor repaint, exterior repaints | Low–Medium | $80–200M | Relationship-driven; less commoditized than new-build |
| Multifamily new build | Full interior and exterior | Medium | $30–80M | Foundation segment; protect share |
| Industrial and manufacturing maintenance | Corrosion control, equipment, shutdown work | Low–Medium | $60–200M | Higher barrier; less bundling pressure |
| Warehouses, logistics, self-storage | Fast-build interiors, metal exteriors | Low | $30–120M | Private owners; repeat portfolios possible |
| Hospitality | Exterior repaints, room refresh, common areas | Low–Medium | $20–90M | Fits exterior credibility |
| Retail and tenant improvements | Quick-turn interiors, brand refresh | Low | $20–80M | Filler work; repeat accounts possible |
| Senior living and private healthcare | Occupied-space repainting | Medium | $30–120M | Sticky work; target independents |
| Municipal and county facilities | Buildings, tanks, small facilities | High variance | $20–100M | Certification-driven, not core growth |

## Strategic Implications

Market sizing supports the thesis that sufficient opportunity exists within Tiers 1–3 to execute the Master Strategy without footprint expansion or standard dilution.

### 12-Month Priorities

1. **Treat commercial painting as multiple markets, not one.** The real advantage lies in segments where repeat maintenance and coatings competence matter more than low-bid volume.

2. **Shift pipeline mix so multifamily is the base, not the whole.** A practical target is multifamily at 60–70% of revenue with 30–40% from two or three add-on verticals.

3. **Select add-on verticals that are private-first and resist drywall bundling.** Priority candidates include industrial maintenance and coatings, hospitality exteriors and refresh cycles, and warehouse and logistics portfolios.

### 5-Year Priorities

1. **Win portfolios, not projects.** Target property management groups, regional hotel operators, industrial operators, and logistics developers in two or three segments.

2. **Build one specialty capability competitors will not chase.** Candidates include corrosion control, complex coatings, and safety program depth.

## Notes

This page defines market context and segment sizing. It does not contain GC intelligence, execution playbooks, or financial KPIs.

**Sensitivity checks for recalibration:**

1. Private nonresidential paint percentage: test 1.5% versus 2.5% of project value.
2. Multifamily per-unit paint cost: test $2,500 versus $5,000 plus 20–40% for common areas and exteriors.
3. Repaint factor: test 1.0× versus 2.5× of new-build scope.

If internal bid history or competitor quotes suggest different unit economics, adjust these inputs and recalculate ranges.
