# Flooring Expansion Pilot Control & Risk Discipline Framework
**LaBrant & Associates LLC**  
**Purpose:** Prevent early-stage failure during flooring expansion by enforcing execution discipline, daily monitoring, and GC-aligned pilot expectations.  
**Status:** Internal control document — use before first flooring award.

---

## Why This Document Exists (Read First)

Flooring expansion is **not** a strategy risk.  
It is an **execution-discipline risk**.

Unlike painting, flooring failures are:
- Latent (often appear weeks or months later)
- Binary (repair vs full replacement)
- Highly visible to owners and lenders

**This document exists to prevent early failure from process drift, not technical incompetence.**

---

## The Single Fatal Failure Mode

> **Allowing flooring installation to proceed without documented, written precondition acceptance.**

This includes:
- Moisture
- Substrate flatness
- Environmental readiness
- Scope clarity

**One exception = one potential project-ending event.**

---

## Pilot Rule (Non-Negotiable)

### ✅ One Project Only
- One GC partner
- One controlled pilot
- No concurrent flooring projects until post-install review is complete

**Two early projects = doubled exposure before learning.**

---

## Mandatory Flooring Acceptance Gate

**NO INSTALLATION MAY PROCEED unless ALL items below are satisfied and logged.**

### 1. Substrate Acceptance (GC-Signed)
- Flatness verified (documented tolerance check)
- Cracks, joints, and defects logged
- Written GC acceptance on record

### 2. Moisture Testing (Documented)
- ASTM test method recorded
- Test locations photographed
- Readings logged with date/time
- Results confirmed within manufacturer limits

### 3. Environmental Readiness
- Temperature 65–85°F logged for ≥48 hours
- Relative humidity logged
- HVAC operational confirmation documented

### 4. Material Control
- Dye lot numbers verified and logged
- Entire install area supplied from single lot
- Attic stock identified and tagged

### 5. Scope Lock
- Transitions defined
- Base responsibility confirmed
- Protection responsibility confirmed
- Exclusions documented

**If any item is missing: WALK.**

---

## Daily Flooring QC & Monitoring (Pilot Standard)

Flooring QC uses the same discipline as painting—but with higher stakes.

### Daily Report MUST Include:
- Ambient temperature and RH (AM + PM)
- Moisture test references (if applicable that day)
- Area installed (SF/LF)
- Installer names
- Material batch/lot used
- Protection installed at end of day
- Photos (before, during, after)

**No report = no work credit.**

---

## Early-Warning Conditions (Stop Work Triggers)

Immediately pause installation if:
- HVAC shuts down or is overridden
- Moisture readings exceed limits
- Substrate damage appears after acceptance
- Other trades damage completed flooring
- GC requests scope beyond documented agreement

Escalate to PM + Owner **before proceeding**.

---

## Pilot GC Selection Criteria

Choose a GC partner who:
- Has prior relationship trust
- Understands certified payroll / WHEDA / municipal requirements
- Accepts formal acceptance gates
- Does not “solve schedule problems by pushing risk downstream”
- Values documentation over speed

**Do NOT pilot with a GC known for:**
- Schedule bullying
- Casual verbal directives
- Back-charging without documentation
- Scope creep normalization

---

## GC Talking Points (Pilot Framing)

Use the following language verbatim or near-verbatim.

### Why a Pilot?
> “We’re expanding flooring in a controlled pilot so we can deliver the same reliability you expect from our painting scope. This first project is about doing it right, not fast.”

### Why Acceptance Gates?
> “Flooring failures are usually substrate- or moisture-driven. These gates protect both of us from latent issues that show up months later.”

### Why Documentation?
> “If something ever fails, documentation is the difference between a warranty fix and a dispute. This protects your project and your owner.”

### What We Will Walk Away From
> “If the space isn’t ready, we won’t install. That’s non-negotiable—because once flooring goes down, responsibility shifts permanently.”

### Why You’re the Right Partner
> “We’re doing this first with partners who value discipline and long-term outcomes, not short-term schedule pressure.”

## Success Criteria for Pilot Completion

The pilot is considered successful only if:
- Installation completes with zero undocumented deviations
- No moisture or substrate-related callbacks occur
- GC feedback confirms reduced friction (not increased)
- Internal PMs demonstrate comfort enforcing gates
- Post-install review identifies refinements before scaling

---

## Scaling Rule

> **No second flooring project may start until the first project is reviewed, aged, and closed out.**

Scaling before learning is prohibited.

---

## Final Reminder

This expansion succeeds **only** if:
- Discipline is enforced even when uncomfortable
- Walking away is viewed as strength, not failure
- Process integrity outranks revenue urgency

**The strategy is sound. Execution discipline keeps it alive.**
