## WisDOT DBE Program: Critical October 2025 Update

### Federal Rule Changes Affecting DBE Certification

**As of October 3, 2025**, the U.S. DOT issued an interim final rule that fundamentally changed the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program:

**Key Changes:**
- Removed race and sex-based presumptions of social and economic disadvantage
- All 1,296 Wisconsin DBE-certified firms must recertify under new criteria
- Certification now requires individual demonstration of both social and economic disadvantage

**WisDOT Response:**
- **Temporarily halted setting DBE goals** for new federally funded contracts
- **Stopped counting DBE participation** toward existing goals until recertification completes
- Developing new recertification processes and guidance
- Contracts awarded before October 3, 2025 maintain their original DBE goals

**No federal timeline exists** for completing the recertification process. This creates significant uncertainty for transportation painting contractors.

**Impact on Your DBE Certification:**
- Your WisDOT DBE certification remains valid but requires recertification under new criteria
- Contact WisDOT Civil Rights office at osecdbe@dot.wi.gov for recertification status and timeline
- The certification still automatically qualifies you as TBE for Milwaukee County projects (unaffected by federal pause)
- City of Milwaukee SBE certification operates independently and remains fully active with 10% bid preference

### Current WisDOT Bridge Projects with Painting Scope

Despite the DBE goal pause, WisDOT continues letting contracts that include painting components:

| Project | Location | Painting Scope | Status | Value |

## Conclusion

The **WisDOT DBE program is in transition** due to the October 2025 federal rule changes requiring recertification of all DBE firms. While this temporarily limits federally-funded transportation painting opportunities, your DBE certification remains valuable for Milwaukee County TBE recognition and should be maintained through the recertification process.

The **ten recurring contract types** identified in this report represent diversified revenue streams independent of DBE program status:

| Contract Type | Value Range | Cycle | Certification Advantage |
|---------------|-------------|-------|------------------------|
| Water tower coating | $150K-$400K | 15-25 years | SSPC QP1/QP2 |
| School district summer painting | $25K-$500K | Annual | DHS lead certification |
| Property management refresh | $5K-$50K | Annual | Volume agreements |
| Religious institution maintenance | $10K-$150K | Project | Lead certification for pre-1978 |
| Fleet and equipment painting | $25K-$100K+ | Ongoing | Spray booth capabilities |
| Retail tenant improvement | $5K-$75K | Continuous | GC relationships |
| Self-storage facility painting | $15K-$75K | 7-10 years | Metal coating expertise |
| Automotive dealership painting | $25K-$200K | Franchise cycle | Brand compliance |
| Medical clinic painting | $10K-$100K | Project | Low-VOC, infection control |
| Industrial maintenance painting | $50K-$500K+ | Annual | Floor coatings, SSPC certs |

**Combined Market Strategy:**

The five-part research series provides a comprehensive roadmap for business development across southeastern Wisconsin's $5,000 to $5 million project range:

- **Part 1:** Municipal opportunities with 10% SBE bid preference and 25% participation goals
- **Part 2:** Merit-shop GC relationships (Stevens, Greenfire, VJS, Catalyst, Moore, McShane)
- **Part 3:** Multifamily developers with 25% DBE and 40% RPP requirements (NCG Hospitality, Barrett Lo)
- **Part 4:** Major retail (Scheels Mayfair, Target Brown Deer) and student housing (The Scion Group)
- **Part 5:** WisDOT transportation and ten recurring contract types

**Priority Actions for Q1 2026:**

1. Complete platform registrations from Part 1
2. Develop Stevens Construction and Greenfire relationships from Part 2
3. Pursue NCG Hospitality hotel opportunities with participation goals from Part 3
4. Monitor Scheels Mayfair GC selection and contact The Scion Group for student housing from Part 4
5. Build recurring contract relationships across the ten categories in Part 5
6. Contact WisDOT Civil Rights about DBE recertification status and timeline

The combination of SBE, DBE, and DHS lead certifications positions LaBrant & Associates for virtually all municipal painting opportunities in the region, while the recurring contract categories provide stable annual revenue independent of certification programs.
