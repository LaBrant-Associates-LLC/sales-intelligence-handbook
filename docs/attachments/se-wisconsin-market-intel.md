**Recommendation:** Significant price increase required or decline future work.

## LB West Construction (AVOID OUT-OF-STATE)
**Job P&L Result:** 200304 - Vista Winds (AZ) lost $62,620 on $469,940 revenue (-13.3% margin)

**Issue:** Out-of-state Arizona work destroyed margins.

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue out-of-state work. Travel, coordination, and market unfamiliarity kill profitability.
