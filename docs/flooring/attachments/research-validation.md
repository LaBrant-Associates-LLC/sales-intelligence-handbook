## Critical Gaps (Address Before First Bid)

### Gap 1: FLOOR360 GC Relationships and Pricing — PARTIALLY RESOLVED

| Confirmed | Still Missing |
|-----------|---------------|
| Revenue: $12.5-15M | Which SE WI GCs they work with |
| Employees: 56-69 | Specific project history (McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire) |
| In-house installation crews | Typical bid pricing for multifamily |
| Leadership: Ryan Koechel (President) | Capacity/backlog status |
| Milwaukee office location | Financial stability verification |
| No DBE/SBE certification | |

**Next Step:** Call FLOOR360 Milwaukee (Matt Nelson or Bob Blake) under pretense of exploring subcontractor partnership.

### Gap 2: Which Flooring Subs Are Actually Bidding Your GC Projects — UNRESOLVED

**Current knowledge:** None

**Missing:** Bid tabulation data showing which flooring contractors are winning McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire, and Stevens multifamily work—and at what prices.

**This is the single most important intelligence gap.**

**Next Step:** Ask McShane estimator directly: "Who do you typically use for flooring on your multifamily projects? Are you happy with them?"

### Gap 3: Carpet/Tile Subcontractor Vetting — UNRESOLVED

**Current knowledge:** BYCO identified as potential partner with DBE/SBE/MBE certs

**Missing:** Verified pricing from BYCO, reference checks, insurance certificates, capacity confirmation. Also need 1-2 backup subcontractors identified and vetted.

**Next Step:** Request meeting with BYCO (262-894-6995) to explore subcontractor partnership.

### Gap 4: Insurance and Workers' Comp Cost Differential — UNRESOLVED

**Current knowledge:** NCCI Code 5437 exists for flooring at ~$4.05-5.00 per $100

**Missing:** Actual quotes from your carrier showing premium impact of adding flooring classification. Need dollar figure before finalizing margin calculations.

**Next Step:** Contact insurance broker for quote on adding NCCI 5437 flooring classification.

### Claims Requiring Correction

| Claim | Status | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| FLOOR360 revenue $12.5-15M | ⚠️ CONTRADICTED | Public estimates show ~$20.8M |
| "13 projects / 1,067 units accessible" | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Filter criteria not documented; WHEDA totals are 27/1,731 |
| "83 days to payment" industry average | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | No source citation |
| BYCO DBE/SBE/MBE certifications | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Claims on website, not independently verified |
| "No DBE/SBE for FLOOR360" | ⚠️ UNVERIFIED | Negative claim needs directory search |

---

## Priority Fix List

Before relying on these documents for bidding:

1. **Separate WHEDA totals vs. your subset:** Add table listing exact 13 projects and how "accessible/serviceable" was defined

2. **Downgrade FLOOR360 revenue/headcount to "estimates":** Remove faux precision, keep business implications

3. **Convert negative certification claims into directory-checked facts:** "No DBE/SBE identified" needs repeatable lookup method + citation

4. **Source high-impact financial benchmarks:** "83 days to payment" and similar numbers must be sourced or removed

5. **Clarify ASTM thresholds:** ASTM defines methods; thresholds are manufacturer-specific. Present as examples and require spec confirmation
