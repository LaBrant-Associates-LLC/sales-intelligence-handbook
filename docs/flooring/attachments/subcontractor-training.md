### Why BYCO Is Interesting

BYCO holds the same DBE/SBE certifications as LaBrant. They could be:
1. A subcontractor partner for flooring work
2. A competitor on diversity-focused projects
3. A potential acquisition/merger target

Their MBE certification adds diversity stacking capabilities.

### BYCO Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Assessment | Mitigation |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Capacity** | HIGH RISK — 1-4 employees cannot handle large multifamily projects alone | Request crew size confirmation; may need multiple subs |
| **Financial** | UNKNOWN — No revenue data available | Request financials, bonding capacity, references |
| **Certification** | NEEDS VERIFICATION — Claims MBE/SBE/DBE but not independently verified | Search state databases before relying |
| **Insurance** | UNKNOWN — No COI on file | Request certificates before any agreement |
| **Experience** | MODERATE — 72 years in business suggests stability | Request specific multifamily project references |
| **Location** | LOW RISK — Mayville is 55 miles from Milwaukee | Verify they regularly work in Milwaukee metro |

## Alternative Subcontractor Candidates

### Option A: FLOOR360 (Madison/Milwaukee)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | Madison HQ, Milwaukee office at 12500 W Silver Spring Dr |
| Phone | 608-274-2500 (Madison) |
| Revenue | $12.5-15 million |
| Employees | 56-69 |
| Union Status | Non-union |
| Certifications | **None identified** |

**Pros:** Large, established, in-house crews, proven commercial capability, active in multifamily

**Cons:** No certifications (no diversity stacking value), Madison-headquartered, could be competitor rather than partner

**Key Contacts:**
- Matt Nelson: mnelson@floor360.com (Milwaukee)
- Bob Blake: bblake@floor360.com (Milwaukee)

**Strategic Consideration:** FLOOR360 could be approached as a subcontractor partner for carpet/tile while LaBrant self-performs LVP, OR they could be a flooring-only competitor.

### Option B: Commercial Flooring Inc (South Milwaukee)

- Listed on Procore as Specialty Contractor
- Specialties: Flooring, Cleaning and Maintenance
- **Status:** Requires additional research

### Option C: Maly Ceramic Tile Company (Sun Prairie)

- Founded 1960
- Specialties: Tile, stone, quarry, LVP, vinyl, rubber, carpet, engineered wood
- Family-owned, 64+ years
- **Concern:** Sun Prairie location (80+ miles from Milwaukee)

### Option D: Bubblegum Flooring (Milwaukee)

- Service Area: Milwaukee, Waukesha, Racine counties
- Commercial flooring installation, replacement, repair
- **Note:** Newer company, appears residential-focused

### Subcontractor Comparison Matrix

| Criteria | BYCO | FLOOR360 | Maly Ceramic | Bubblegum |
|----------|------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Milwaukee Proximity | 55 mi | Office in MKE | 80+ mi | In MKE |
| Certifications | MBE/SBE/DBE (claimed) | None | Unknown | Unknown |
| Capacity | Very Small (1-4) | Large (56-69) | Unknown | Unknown |
| Multifamily Experience | Unknown | Confirmed | Unknown | Unknown |
| Union Status | Non-union | Non-union | Unknown | Non-union |
| Partnership Potential | High | Moderate | Moderate | Low |

**Recommendation:** Pursue BYCO for certification stacking value but develop FLOOR360 relationship as capacity backup. BYCO's small size means they likely cannot handle sole-source flooring on large multifamily projects.
