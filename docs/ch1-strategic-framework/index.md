# Chapter 1: Strategy

_The decision framework that determines which opportunities are worth pursuing._

## Executive Summary

This chapter defines the strategic filters that protect margin and prevent wasted effort. It establishes the geography tier system, segment priorities, and guardrails that govern all downstream execution. Sales and estimating use this to qualify opportunities before investing time. Leadership uses it to align resources with strategic intent.

## Quick Navigation

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [Master Strategy](master-strategy.md) | Guardrails, Year 1–5 roadmap, 90-day sprint |
| [Market Sizing](market-sizing.md) | Quantifies opportunity within our doctrine |
| [Diversification](diversification.md) | Defines where and how expansion is permitted |

## Core Doctrine

**Strategic position:** Stay open-shop, leverage certifications, expand beyond multifamily without abandoning it. Expansion targets are renovation-heavy senior living and hospitality projects within Tiers 1–3.

**Margin protection:** Three filters govern pursuit decisions. First, tier discipline—not all geographies deserve equal effort. Second, GC selection—some partners compound margin while others destroy it, as detailed in [Chapter 2](../ch2-gc-intelligence/). Third, segment focus—bid only where operating strengths apply, with playbooks in [Chapter 5](../ch5-market-segments/).

**The Five-Tier Geography System**

| Tier | Geography | Pursuit Posture |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **1** | Milwaukee Metro + I-94 Corridor | Maximum effort. Home base. |
| **2** | Madison / Dane County | Active pursuit. Second production pod. |
| **3** | Fox Valley + Green Bay | Selective. Industrial + senior living. |
| **4** | Wisconsin Dells | Opportunistic. Hospitality refresh only. |
| **5** | Superior / Northern WI | Specialty only. High-margin or don't travel. |

This tier system governs Chapters 2–6. Escalation rules and exceptions live in [Diversification](diversification.md).

## Notes

This chapter establishes doctrine only. GC-specific intelligence lives in [Chapter 2](../ch2-gc-intelligence/). Segment playbooks live in [Chapter 5](../ch5-market-segments/). Financial benchmarks live in [Chapter 7](../ch7-sales-system.md).
