## IOC Construction (Primary Threat)

**Threat Level: HIGH — Your closest business model competitor**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 1425 Paramount Pkwy, Suite B, Batavia, IL 60510 |
| Service Area | Greater Chicago and **Milwaukee Area** |
| Phone | 630-406-3000 |
| Key Contacts | David Lockhart, Tim Ross |
| Revenue | $9.5M (ZoomInfo) to $25-50M (other sources) |
| Employees | 51-200 |
| Union Status | **Non-union (merit shop)** |
| Founded | ~1990 (35 years in business) |
| Certifications | **None identified** |

### Business Model

Full-service GC for multifamily capital improvements offering painting, flooring, roofing, and construction services. They explicitly market to property managers for apartment/multifamily facilities, condo/townhome associations, and commercial high-rise.

**Services Include:**
- Interior & Exterior Painting
- Flooring (LVP, carpet, tile, epoxy)
- Roofing (commercial, multifamily)
- Siding and Trim
- Facade Replacement
- Property Maintenance
- Interior Build-outs

### Why They Matter

IOC is essentially the Chicago version of what LaBrant is considering becoming. They've been serving the Chicagoland and Milwaukee market for 35 years with this integrated model. They target the exact same customer base—property managers and multifamily owners.

### Competitive Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| (+) | Established 35-year track record |
| (+) | Full GC capabilities (roofing, construction) |
| (+) | Strong technology adoption (JobTread, drone tech) |
| (-) | Chicago-based, Milwaukee is secondary market |
| (-) | No DBE/SBE certifications identified |
| (-) | Larger overhead structure |
| (-) | 90-mile distance creates response-time disadvantage |

**LaBrant Opportunity:** Your Milwaukee-local presence, certification advantages (DBE, SBE), and existing GC relationships give you a local advantage IOC cannot match on diversity-focused projects.

## Thomas A. Mason (Union Model)

**Threat Level: MODERATE — Different market segment**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 1501 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr, Milwaukee, WI 53212 |
| Phone | 414-271-6688 |
| Founded | 1912 (112 years in business) |
| Employees | 80+ union trades workers |
| Revenue | $12M+ (company), $21.6M (ZoomInfo 2025) |
| Union Status | **UNION (IUPAT painters + Carpenters)** |
| Certifications | **DBE, MBE, SBE, HUB, WHEDA, Lead Abatement** |
| Service Areas | Wisconsin AND Colorado |

### Business Model

Wisconsin's largest painting contractor with integrated flooring division. Full-service painting and flooring for commercial, institutional, and industrial projects.

**Flooring Services:**
- Ceramic/quarry tile
- Resilient flooring (LVP, linoleum)
- Carpet and carpet tile
- Pre-finished engineered wood
- Vinyl wall covering

### Notable Projects

- Milwaukee City Hall ($60M restoration)
- Northwestern Mutual Towers/Commons
- General Mitchell International Airport
- The Trade Hotel

### Why They're NOT Your Direct Competition

1. **Union-only** — Cannot bid merit-shop multifamily projects
2. **Institutional focus** — Government, airports, corporate HQ, not apartments
3. **Price point** — Union labor costs price them out of cost-sensitive multifamily
4. **Relationship base** — Works with union GCs (JP Cullen, Miron, Mortenson)

**Strategic Implication:** Thomas A. Mason proves the painting + flooring model works at scale in Wisconsin (112 years, $21M revenue). Their union structure creates a massive gap in the merit-shop multifamily market that LaBrant can fill.

## FLOOR360 (Flooring Specialist)

**Threat Level: MODERATE — Capable but lacks certification leverage**

| Attribute | Details | Verification Status |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Headquarters | 5117 Verona Rd, Madison, WI 53711 | Confirmed |
| Milwaukee Office | 12500 W Silver Spring Dr (opened 2019) | Confirmed |
| Phone | 608-274-2500 (Madison) | Confirmed |
| Founded | 1998 (26+ years) | Confirmed |
| Ownership | Laurie and Bob Tobe (founders); Ryan Koechel (President) | Confirmed |
| CFO | Robert Richter | Confirmed |
| Revenue | **$12.5-15 million** (estimates vary to $20.8M) | Partially verified |
| Employees | **56-69 employees** | Confirmed |
| Union Status | Non-union | Confirmed |
| DBE/SBE Certification | **None identified** | Verified — significant LaBrant advantage |

### Installation Model: In-House Teams (NOT Subcontractors)

FLOOR360 explicitly states "Installation teams from FLOOR360 have the knowledge and skillsets to complete even the most challenging installations." Their Indeed career page confirms they employ installers directly.

**Significance:**
- They control quality directly (no subcontractor variability)
- They have scheduling flexibility with employee crews
- They have invested in training and retention
- They are NOT a "broker" model like some competitors

### Market Focus

Their commercial portfolio page explicitly lists:
- Senior Housing
- Student Housing
- Low Income Housing
- Apartments
- Condominiums
- Resorts/Hotels
- Restaurants/Retail

They completed The Adria apartments in downtown Madison—confirming active multifamily new construction work. They handle certified payrolls, prevailing wage, AIA billing, and have performance bonding capacity.

### Key Contacts

**Milwaukee Commercial Team:**
- Matt Nelson: mnelson@floor360.com
- Bob Blake: bblake@floor360.com

**Madison Commercial Team:**
- Billy Andersen: bandersen@floor360.com
- Travis Lindhardt: tlindhardt@floor360.com
- Jeff Rathsack: jrathsack@floor360.com

### Competitive Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| (+) | 26-year track record with proven commercial capability |
| (+) | In-house installation teams (quality control) |
| (+) | Milwaukee presence since 2019 |
| (+) | Performance bonding capacity |
| (+) | Strong residential volume provides cash flow stability |
| (-) | Madison-headquartered (60 miles from Milwaukee core) |
| (-) | No painting capability (cannot offer Division 9 package) |
| (-) | Milwaukee office is secondary market |
| (-) | Residential-heavy portfolio may limit commercial focus |
| (-) | **No DBE/SBE certification** — significant disadvantage on WHEDA/municipal |

**Strategic Implication:** FLOOR360 is a formidable flooring competitor but cannot match LaBrant's potential painting+flooring package. Their lack of certification is exploitable on diversity-focused projects. They could also be a subcontractor partner if LaBrant wants to sub flooring initially while building capability.

## QBC (Quest Building Corp)

**Threat Level: LOW — Different bundle pattern, potential partner**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 7,500 SF office + 27,000 SF fabrication shop, DeForest WI |
| Service Area | Dane County, Madison, Milwaukee, Fox Valley, Northern IL |
| Founded | 1998 (27 years) |
| Union Status | **Merit shop (non-union)** |
| Project Range | $50,000 tenant rehabs to $115M+ multifamily |

### Bundled Scopes

- Rough Carpentry
- Finish Carpentry
- Cabinetry
- Countertops
- **Flooring**
- Materials Supply

**What They DO NOT Do:** Painting.

### Value Proposition

"Managing multiple subcontractors creates coordination chaos and schedule risk. QBC eliminates the chaos by bundling your labor and materials under one contract, one schedule, and one point of accountability."

### Key Clients

Stevens Construction Corp., Forward Management, McGann Construction, Fried & Associates, DSI Real Estate Group, 1848 Construction—all merit-shop GCs in LaBrant's target market.

**Strategic Implication:** QBC validates the multi-scope model at significant scale with merit-shop GCs. Their explicit absence of painting creates the Division 9 gap LaBrant intends to fill. Consider QBC as either:
1. A complementary partner (LaBrant handles painting, QBC handles carpentry/cabinets/flooring)
2. The model to emulate for multi-trade positioning

## Suburban Drywall

**Threat Level: LOW — Different bundle, no flooring**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | Waukesha & Lake Mills, WI |
| Founded | 1978 |
| Union Status | Merit shop |
| Revenue | $47.7 million (2025) |
| Employees | 200+ |
| Ownership | Private equity backed (AVALT, VantEdge Partners acquired 2022) |

### Service Evolution

- 1978: Founded as drywall
- 1999: Added insulation
- 2002: Added painting and staining
- 2009: Added light-gauge steel studs

**What They DO NOT Do:** Flooring.

### Key Client Quote

> "Suburban Drywall is one of our most trusted partners and their involvement adds a significant level of certainty to the potential success of the project." — Jonathan Koch, Stevens Construction Corp.

**Strategic Implication:** Suburban demonstrates that expanding from one trade to complementary trades works at scale ($47M revenue). They went drywall → insulation → painting. LaBrant could go painting → flooring.

## CertaPro Clarification

**Finding: NOT a Soft Flooring Competitor**

CertaPro Painters of Milwaukee offers flooring services, but they are limited to **epoxy and polyurea coatings only**—garage floors, industrial floors, pool decks, and patios. This is essentially an extension of their painting/coatings business, not soft flooring.

| CertaPro Offers | CertaPro Does NOT Offer |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Epoxy floor coatings | LVP/LVT installation |
| Polyurea coatings (Citadel brand) | Carpet installation |
| Concrete staining | Sheet vinyl |
| Garage floor finishing | Tile installation |
| Industrial floor coatings | Any "soft" flooring |

**Competitive Implication:** CertaPro is NOT competing in the multifamily flooring space. Their flooring offering is industrial/garage coating work—completely different market segment.
