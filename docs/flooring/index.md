# Flooring Services Expansion

**LaBrant & Associates LLC — Division 9 Finishes Expansion**

This section documents LaBrant's strategic expansion into flooring services as a complement to existing commercial painting operations. Flooring falls under CSI Division 9 (Finishes)—the same division as painting—creating natural scope synergy for multifamily GC relationships.

---

## Strategic Summary

**Gap Identified:** No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor currently offers both painting AND flooring for multifamily construction.

**Opportunity:** Position LaBrant as "Single-Source Division 9 Finishes" for McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire, and Stevens projects—mirroring how Suburban Drywall packages drywall + painting.

**Certification Advantage:** DBE/SBE status on combined painting + flooring scope increases value on WHEDA and diversity-focused projects.

**Market Sizing:** $6.9M addressable market from 2025 WHEDA pipeline alone. Realistic Year 1 capture: $560K–$1.3M incremental flooring revenue.
