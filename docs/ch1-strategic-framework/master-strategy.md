# Master Strategy

_Part of [Chapter 1: Strategy](index.md) — defines the guardrails, time horizons, and 90-day execution plan._

---

## Context

This page assumes the definitions and scope established in [Chapter 1: Strategy](index.md). It does not restate tier systems, market definitions, or global guardrails.

---

## Guardrails

These are filters, not guidelines. Violating any guardrail requires leadership escalation.

1. **Open-shop first.** Work that requires union signatory commitments is out of scope unless explicitly approved by ownership. Union-signatory GCs are classified in [Chapter 2](../ch2-gc-intelligence/).

2. **Wisconsin only.** We do not pursue out-of-state work. Geographic expansion outside Wisconsin has consistently destroyed margin. This is non-negotiable.

3. **Private is preferred.** Priority is given to owners, developers, property managers, and open-shop GCs. Public work is pursued selectively where certification leverage applies, as detailed in [Chapter 3](../ch3-municipal/).

4. **Multifamily remains the foundation.** Diversification stacks on top of multifamily; it does not replace it. Multifamily is the production base for the next decade.

Geography follows the 5-tier system defined in the [Strategy Overview](index.md). This page references tiers but does not redefine them.

## Time Horizons

Strategy only works when time horizons are explicit and actionable.

### Year 1: Foundation

The objective is to maximize win rate and margin within Tiers 1–2 using proven partners and repeatable scopes. Year 1 is about tightening filters and enforcing discipline, not expanding reach.

### Priority Plays

1. **Owner-direct repaint programs.** Target hotels, HOAs, condominium associations, property managers, and light commercial portfolios within Tiers 1–2. Lead with schedule certainty, safety documentation, and clean closeout packages.

2. **Light industrial maintenance accounts.** Target warehouses, manufacturing facilities, and food/beverage plants along the I-94 corridor and Fox Valley. Sell shutdown readiness and coatings competence. Focus on recurring outage windows and maintenance budgets.

3. **Senior living and private clinics (opportunistic).** Pursue only when the opportunity passes all guardrails and the GC is already classified as a strategic partner in [Chapter 2](../ch2-gc-intelligence/).

4. **Repeat GC interior renovation work.** Focus on projects with known scope patterns that reward sequencing discipline and crew continuity.

### Years 2–5: Scale

The objective is to earn optionality without diluting the core. No new market, segment, or geography is pursued at scale without prior validation inside the core.

### Expansion Plays

1. **Program agreements.** Target 10–15 anchor accounts with annual or portfolio-based contracts. Prioritize property management firms, regional hotel operators, and senior living operators with multi-site footprints.

2. **Geographic expansion.** Extend multifamily and senior living presence into Tier 2 (Madison) and selectively into Tier 3 (Fox Valley, Green Bay) only with partners that have already proven performance in Tier 1.

3. **Capability investment.** Add exterior access capabilities such as swing stage and aerial lift ownership only when ROI is validated by repeat demand. Do not speculate on equipment.

## 90-Day Sprint

The next 90 days are about alignment and discipline, not growth. If nothing changes in 90 days, the strategy is not being enforced.

### Weeks 1–4: Foundation

1. Reclassify all active pipeline opportunities by tier, GC status, and segment.
2. Kill any bids that violate guardrails.
3. Enforce GC qualification before estimating begins.
4. Build the Top-60 target list: 20 owners/developers, 20 property managers/HOA managers, 20 facility/plant managers—split by segment and geography.
5. Define bid gate criteria. If an opportunity fails the gate, pass without estimating.
6. Create three productized offers aligned to core segments: exterior refresh, shutdown paint, and unit-turn program.
7. Produce two case studies with closeout documentation supporting those offers.

**Deliverable:** Clean, qualified pipeline aligned to doctrine.

### Weeks 5–8: Execution

1. Launch outreach cadence: 15 warm touches and 10 cold touches per week.
2. Schedule at least 12 relationship meetings with decision-makers from the Top-60 list.
3. Bid only gated work—no speculative bids outside Tiers 1–2.
4. Win 1–2 pilot projects and push each toward a program or portfolio conversation.

**Deliverable:** Concentrated effort on winnable work with supporting sales assets.

### Weeks 9–12: Lock

1. Review win rate and margin against baseline.
2. Identify which guardrails prevented losses.
3. Refine scope templates and estimate narratives based on pilot learnings.
4. Lock the next-quarter pipeline with explicit tier and segment classifications.
5. Formalize what stays, what stops, and what escalates.
6. Hand off metric definitions to [Chapter 7](../ch7-sales-system.md) for ongoing tracking.

**Deliverable:** Strategy enforcement validated by results.

## Capabilities Roadmap

Execution requires deliberate capability build-out. Capabilities exist to support discipline, not complexity.

### People

1. Assign an Account Captain per priority segment: hospitality, senior living, and industrial.
2. Identify a coatings lead responsible for spec review and crew training.
3. Clarify ownership of key GC and developer relationships.

### Process

1. Establish a weekly change-order review cadence with capture rate as a tracked metric.
2. Develop standard scope templates by segment to reduce estimating variance.
3. Formalize no-bid and escalation documentation.
4. Build a proof package: two case studies (one exterior repaint, one industrial/coatings), a safety plan narrative, and three references.
5. Develop closeout package standards that document schedule adherence and quality.

### Tools

1. Create an exterior access plan with rent-vs-own decision rules based on project frequency.
2. Acquire containment and surface prep equipment as needed for coatings work.
3. Develop standardized estimating packages for core scopes.
4. Build exterior access and logistics planning templates.

## Validation Scenarios

These scenarios test whether the strategy is being followed. If expected outcomes are not achieved, investigate guardrail violations or execution gaps.

1. **Senior living (Tiers 1–3).** Identify 12 decision-makers at senior living operators or developers. Conduct 4 refresh or new-build bids. Expected outcome: 1 award with a short cycle of 30 days or less and low administrative burden, converting to an annual maintenance agreement.

2. **Hospitality (Tiers 1–2).** Identify 10 target hotels or HOAs in Milwaukee Metro or Madison. Complete 20 introductions and 6 site walks. Expected outcome: 2 proposals accepted within 90 days, with at least 1 converting to a repeat-cycle agreement.

3. **Industrial (Tier 3, selective).** Identify 15 plants or warehouses in Fox Valley or I-94 corridor. Complete 10 facility manager meetings and 3 shutdown window bids. Expected outcome: 1 pilot shutdown job awarded with coatings spec compliance documented and margin meeting the minimum threshold.

4. **Competitive defense.** When a competitor undercuts by 10–15% on a multifamily interior, the expected response is to decline or reframe with an alternate scope or schedule premium. Do not chase the price floor unless the margin rule holds. This scenario tests enforcement of guardrails; detailed competitive response tactics live in [Diversification](diversification.md).
