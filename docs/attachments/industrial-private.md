# Part 6.3: Emerging Industrial, Private Facilities & Niche Markets | SE Wisconsin
**Date:** 12/25/25 | **Revision:** 0
**Changelog:** Initial research baseline - Industrial facilities, private clubs, religious institutions, food processing, utilities, transit facilities

---

## Executive Summary

This supplemental research expands the market intelligence framework beyond traditional municipal and commercial segments into emerging industrial opportunities, private institutional facilities, and niche markets that align with LaBrant & Associates' non-union, certified contractor positioning. Key discoveries include:

1. **I-94 East-West Corridor Project**: $1.7 billion infrastructure project with construction starting Fall 2025 - creates massive downstream opportunities
2. **Private Country Clubs**: Active renovation cycle with $2.5M+ projects at Blue Mound, Ozaukee CC (2026 clubhouse renovation planned)
3. **Religious Institutions**: Archdiocese of Milwaukee's ~200 parishes represent significant ongoing maintenance market
4. **Industrial Corridor**: HSA Commercial Real Estate building 1.9 million SF of speculative warehouse space along I-94
5. **Automotive Dealerships**: Russ Darrow Group operates 15+ locations with 3 body shops and ongoing facility needs

**Critical Finding:** Many of these segments operate outside union-dominated procurement channels, creating favorable competitive dynamics for certified merit-shop contractors.

---

### Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD)

*Previously covered in Part 6.2 - Key supplement:*

**Industrial Coating Specialization Required:**
- Wastewater treatment environments are highly corrosive
- Typical coatings: Epoxy linings, polyurea, coal tar epoxy alternatives
- Certifications beneficial: SSPC-QP1 (Shop), SSPC-QP2 (Field)

**Alternative Approach:**
- Contact Molson Coors Facilities Management directly
- Focus on maintenance/refresh work outside major construction projects
- Building age (1855 origins) means ongoing maintenance requirements

---

**Food Processing Environment Considerations:**
- FDA/USDA compliance requirements for coatings
- Food-safe paint products required in production areas
- Washdown-resistant coatings for processing rooms

**Opportunity:** Ownership transition often triggers facility assessments and upgrades. Contact new ownership (Amylu Foods) regarding facility maintenance plans.

---

### Cold Storage & Distribution Facilities

- Condensation management critical
- Often 24/7 operations requiring phased work

**New Facility Opportunity:** Winnesota's new Milwaukee cold storage facility (opening March 2025) represents potential new construction painting opportunity.

- Post-construction commercial development
- Stadium Interchange area redevelopment

**Recent I-94 North-South Corridor Development:**
Major developments completed along I-94 corridor:
- Amazon warehouse and distribution facility
- Uline corporate headquarters expansion
- Foxconn campus (scaled back but $600M invested)

**Development Pattern:** Speculative construction (no tenants lined up) indicates confidence in market absorption - these buildings will need tenant improvement painting upon lease-up.

**Access Strategy:**
- Monitor Kenosha County permits for GC identification
- Contact HSA Commercial directly for subcontractor prequalification
- Focus on tenant improvement painting as buildings lease up

---

### Industrial Park Inventory

**Key Industrial Developments:**
