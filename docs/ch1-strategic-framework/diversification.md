# Diversification Strategy

**Scope (exact ask):** Identify Wisconsin market segments and geographies to pursue (next 12 months + 5 years) to diversify beyond multifamily, factoring non‑union constraints and local competitor behavior.

---

## 1A) Executive summary -- where to go and what to sell
### The thesis
Keep **multifamily as the production base**, and add **repeatable, private‑owner, repaint/renovation and light‑industrial coatings** work that:
- is less dominated by "bundle the drywall" competitors,
- is less union‑saturated than heavy civil / major institutional,
- rewards systems, scheduling discipline, and coating competence.

### 12‑month priorities (quick wins)
1. **Hospitality renovations + refresh cycles** (Milwaukee, Madison, Wisconsin Dells, Green Bay)
2. **Senior living / assisted living** (SE WI + Fox Valley)
3. **Light industrial & manufacturing maintenance coatings** (Fox Valley + I‑94 corridor)
4. **HOA/condo association exterior repaint programs** (Milwaukee metro + lake country)
5. **Selective municipal/county facility maintenance** (small-mid size, open‑shop friendly)

### 5‑year priorities (becoming a larger player)
1. **Own "occupied‑facility repaint/reno"** across hospitality, senior living, healthcare clinics, and commercial property portfolios
2. **Build a dedicated industrial coatings lane** (plants/warehouses, shutdown work, corrosion control)
3. **Win statewide repeat accounts** (property managers, facility management firms, franchisors, regional owner groups)
4. **Selective capability expansion** (access systems, parking/striping if ROI pencils, specialty coatings)

### What to avoid (given your model)
- **UW System / union‑leaning institutional pipelines** unless you have a true carve‑out path
- **Mega‑projects with explicit union labor expectations/PLAs** (e.g., some high‑profile data center builds have been described as predominantly union construction labor)

---

## 1B) Market signals & why these segments are "real" in Wisconsin
### Multifamily stays strong (base work)
Madison has an explicit housing production goal of **15,000 new homes by 2030**, tracked publicly by the City. This keeps multifamily development/permit activity a durable base you can keep feeding from while you diversify.
- City of Madison Housing Tracker / Housing Forward: https://www.cityofmadison.com/dpced/community-development/housing/housing-tracker
- Housing Forward: https://www.cityofmadison.com/mayor/priorities/housing-forward

### Renovation spend is visible (hospitality)
Major Milwaukee hotels have completed or announced large renovation programs, which is exactly the type of "high‑schedule‑sensitivity repaint/refresh" work where a disciplined specialty contractor can win.
- Hilton Milwaukee $42M renovation completion (Dec 2025): https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/hilton-renovation-complete
- Pfister Hotel lobby renovations completed early 2025: https://www.thepfisterhotel.com/renovations/
- Marcus / downtown hotel renovation context: https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2025/09/18/marcus-reverses-course-on-hotel-closure/

Wisconsin Dells continues adding/refreshing hospitality inventory (high repaint/turn scope potential).

### Industrial investment is real (but choose the lane)
Wisconsin continues seeing large industrial/tech investment. The *headline* builds may skew union; **your lane is the adjacent and follow‑on**: warehouses, offices, supplier facilities, ongoing repaint/maintenance, and industrial coatings work.

- Reuters on Microsoft Wisconsin data center investment (Sep 2025): https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-boosts-wisconsin-data-center-spending-7-billion-2025-09-18/

### Public work: prevailing wage is a moving target (plan for it)
Wisconsin's **state prevailing wage** was repealed (state‑funded highway projects) per WisDOT; **federal Davis‑Bacon** can still apply on federally funded projects. Also, proposed legislation has sought to re‑strengthen prevailing wage enforcement, which could change your public‑work economics over a 5‑year horizon.

## 2A) Geography -- where to expand inside Wisconsin
### Tier 1 (0-12 months): "Drive‑time density" -- best ROI
**Milwaukee Metro + I‑94 Corridor (Milwaukee -> Madison)**
- Why: dense property inventory, renovation cycles, multifamily, senior living, healthcare clinics, and owner/operator concentration.
- Target buyer groups: hotel asset managers, property managers, REIT/regional owners, senior living operators, local developers.

### Tier 2 (0-24 months): "Second production pod"
**Madison / Dane County**
- Why: sustained housing production focus (City goal + public tracker) and a steady private development pipeline.
- Watch‑out: government/state campus work can be more union‑leaning; aim private development, private education, healthcare clinics.

### Tier 3 (12-36 months): "Industrial + growth corridor"
**Fox Valley (Appleton/Oshkosh/Neenah/Menasha/Kaukauna) + Green Bay**
- Why: manufacturing base, distribution, and steady commercial growth; senior living developments are visible in this corridor.
- Example senior living development signal: Fox Cities Chamber announcement for a 75‑unit assisted living development (Fox Crossing): https://foxcitieschamber.com/blog/copperstone-assisted-living-memory-care-announces-new-75-unit-assisted-living-development-in-fox-crossing-wisconsin/

### Tier 4 (opportunistic): "Tourism repaint engine"
**Wisconsin Dells**
- Why: high room turnover + constant refresh. You can build repeat repaint programs with a handful of owner groups.

### Tier 5 (specialty only): "Statewide travel jobs"
**Superior / Northern Wisconsin (only for the right coating/access job)**
- Why: travel is expensive; do it only when margin + uniqueness (industrial coating, access complexity) justify it.

## 3A) Segment targets -- what to pursue in the next 12 months

### Segment 1 -- Hospitality renovations & refresh (private)
**Why it fits:** Tight schedules, occupied environments, high expectation for clean punchlists and coordination. Renovation activity is visible in Milwaukee and statewide tourism nodes.

**What you sell (positioning):**
- "Occupied‑facility production painting": night work, rapid floor‑by‑floor turns, zero‑surprise scheduling.
- "Scope clarity that protects reopening dates."

**Primary buyers:** hotel ownership groups, asset managers, facilities directors, renovation GCs who can use open‑shop subs.

**Competitive angle:** integrated drywall/paint firms don't always want the disruption risk; union painters can be more expensive.

**Proof points you already have:** large exterior repaint experience (Hyatt Regency exterior repaint) -- perfect credibility anchor.

**Validation scenario (pilot):**
- Win 1 hotel refresh package (e.g., 80-200 room repaint scope) with a hard reopen date; deliver within schedule with <2% punchlist rework and documented daily production.

---

### Segment 2 -- Senior living / assisted living / memory care (private)
**Why it fits:** A mix of new build + steady repaint/refresh; operators value reliability, cleanliness, and resident disruption control.

**What you sell:**
- "Healthcare‑lite standards without healthcare‑bid headaches": containment, odor control, night/weekend scheduling.
- Multi‑phase repaint programs.

**Primary buyers:** owner/operators, development firms, facility managers, design‑build teams.

**Where to aim:** SE WI + Fox Valley (multiple projects/signals).

**Validation scenario (pilot):**
- Land 1 new‑build senior living + 1 occupied repaint program within 12 months; convert to annual facility paint maintenance agreement.

Sources (project signals):

- Pewaukee senior living expansion (PHS): https://preshomes.org/news/phs-news/kirkland-crossings-breaks-ground-on-new-development/

---

### Segment 3 -- Light industrial & manufacturing maintenance coatings
**Why it fits:** You already have crews with industrial background and two‑component/epoxy experience. Plants need scheduled shutdown work, corrosion control, and durable coatings.

**What you sell:**
- "Plant‑safe coatings execution": safety compliance, pre‑task planning, surface prep discipline.
- "Shutdown painting that doesn't extend downtime."

**Primary buyers:** facility managers, plant engineers, maintenance managers, OEMs, industrial property owners.

**Where to aim:**
- Fox Valley + Green Bay (manufacturing density)
- I‑94 corridor (Racine/Kenosha/Waukesha) for industrial parks and supplier facilities

**Validation scenario (pilot):**
- Secure a 2‑site annual maintenance coating contract (even small) with documented coating specs, inspection sign‑offs, and a repeatable shutdown playbook.

- Reuters on Microsoft WI investment (Sep 2025): https://www.reuters.com/business/microsoft-boosts-wisconsin-data-center-spending-7-billion-2025-09-18/

---

### Segment 4 -- Condo/HOA + multifamily exterior repaint programs (private)
**Why it fits:** High repeat potential, less "new build bid day" bloodbath, and it leverages your multifamily credibility. Exterior repaints also reduce dependence on new‑construction cycles.

**What you sell:**
- Multi‑building phased repaint programs
- Warranty clarity + predictable production
- Resident communication templates

**Primary buyers:** HOA boards, property management firms, condo associations, multifamily owners.

**Validation scenario (pilot):**
- Close 1 HOA portfolio agreement covering 3+ buildings with a 2-3 year rolling repaint plan and a defined annual budget.

---

### Segment 5 -- Select municipal/county facility maintenance (careful selection)
**Why it fits:** Steady work if you can access it without triggering union issues; many are smaller projects where performance and responsiveness win.

**What you sell:**
- Fast response maintenance painting
- After‑hours scheduling for public safety buildings, libraries, admin offices

**Primary buyers:** facilities directors, building managers, county maintenance teams.

**Rules of engagement:**
- Avoid union‑heavy agencies/campuses by default (e.g., UW system)
- Watch funding source (federal dollars can invoke Davis‑Bacon)

**Validation scenario (pilot):**
- Win 2 small municipal "task order" style projects (under 60 days) and convert to an on‑call paint maintenance contract.

---

## 3B) Optional adjacency plays (only if the ROI is proven)
### Traffic markings / striping (parking lots, garages)
- **Upside:** Pairs naturally with parking facilities repaint scopes (many painters list parking facilities work, but striping is a separate niche).
- **Downside:** seasonal scheduling + spec/municipal compliance learning curve.
- **Recommendation:** start by **subcontracting** or renting equipment for 2-3 jobs before buying gear.

### Epoxy floor coatings
You said you don't do epoxy floors today, but you *can*. Consider only if you repeatedly see:
- warehouse/industrial clients asking for floors, or
- parking structures needing coatings.

---

## 4A) Competitor landscape -- what they do and the gap you can exploit

### Craftmaster Painting (local competitor; broad service menu)
- Markets served include commercial categories like manufacturing/warehouses, senior & multi‑unit housing, hotels, parking facilities, schools and more (broad footprint; often competes on volume/coverage).
  - Services list: https://cmpaint.com/services
  - About page examples of project types (hotels, schools, etc.): https://cmpaint.com/about-us
  - Procore listing: https://www.procore.com/network/p/craftmaster-painting-llc-franklin

**Strategic response:** Don't out‑volume them. Win on **risk control** (estimate narratives, schedule credibility, occupied‑facility execution) and **repeat owner programs**.

### States Drywall & Painting (bundle advantage)
- Offers both drywall and painting (bundle undercut risk).
  - BBB profile: https://www.bbb.org/us/wi/oak-creek/profile/drywall-contractors/states-drywall-painting-inc-0694-1000000196
  - Blue Book listing: https://www.thebluebook.com/iProView/1443682/states-drywall-painting-inc/subcontractors/

**Strategic response:** Move share away from "new build bundle bidding" into **repaints/renos/industrial coatings** where bundling is less decisive.

### Suburban Drywall (finishing platform with painting)
- Provides drywall, framing, insulation **and painting/staining** services; shows multifamily projects including painting scope.
  - Company site: https://suburbandrywall.com/
  - Painting service page: https://suburbandrywall.com/services/painting-staining/
  - Multifamily project example (includes painting): https://suburbandrywall.com/ourwork/multi-family/

**Strategic response:** Keep your strong working relationship where they remain the drywall contractor and you remain the specialty painter. If they bundle, compete with:
- **spec‑driven coating performance**, and
- **tight schedule delivery** they can't resource.

### Dublin Contractors (benchmark for access/exterior capability)
- Positions in commercial/industrial/institutional and highlights ownership of swing stages/aerial lifts and coating breadth.
  - Company overview: https://dublincontractorsinc.com/

**Strategic response:** If you want more high‑rise/exterior work, either:
- invest in access capabilities (swing stage + training), or
- partner with access providers while you own coatings execution.

### Sanchez Painting Contractors (commercial/industrial)
- Positions as commercial & industrial painting.
  - Company site: https://sanchezptg.com/
  - BBB profile: https://www.bbb.org/us/wi/milwaukee/profile/painting-contractors/sanchez-painting-contractors-inc-0694-14000699
  - Procore sectors include commercial/healthcare/industrial: https://www.procore.com/network/p/sanchez-painting-contractors-inc-milwaukee

**Strategic response:** Differentiate on **programmatic repaint**, **owner‑direct relationships**, and **estimate transparency** (narratives + production assumptions).

### Programmed Painting (commercial/healthcare/institutional mix)
- Procore listing indicates commercial/healthcare/institutional/residential sectors.
  - Procore listing: https://www.procore.com/network/p/programmed-painting-milwaukee

**Strategic response:** Treat as a competitor in healthcare/institutional repaint scopes; verify union expectations per project, but don't assume.

## 5A) 12‑month go‑to‑market plan (tactical)

### Step 1 -- Build 4 vertical "hit lists" (2 weeks)
1. Hospitality owners/asset managers (Milwaukee, Madison, Dells, Green Bay)
2. Senior living operators/developers (SE WI + Fox Valley)
3. Industrial park owners + facility managers (Fox Valley + I‑94)
4. Property management firms (HOA/condo + multifamily owners)

**Output:** 25-40 targets per vertical with named decision makers.

### Step 2 -- Create 3 capability one‑pagers (1 week)
- Occupied facility repaint/reno
- Industrial coatings & shutdown work
- Exterior access & envelope coatings (even if partnered initially)

### Step 3 -- Run 90‑day outreach sprints (repeatable)
- Weekly cadence: 15 warm touches + 10 cold touches + 3 in‑person site walks
- Convert to **site walk -> budget number -> scoped proposal**

### Step 4 -- Protect your base from Craftmaster's low‑bid cycle
- Bid gate: pursue only multifamily jobs where you can win by schedule certainty, QA, and relationship--not by being the lowest number.
- Keep 10-15% capacity reserved for higher‑margin repaint/reno.

---

## 5B) 5‑year growth plan (how you become a larger player)

### Year 1-2: "Second lane" without breaking ops
- Add repeat accounts in hospitality/senior living/industrial maintenance.
- Build templates: estimate narratives, shutdown playbooks, occupied‑work checklists.

### Year 2-3: "Second production pod" in Madison
- Stand up a small Madison crew/lead (not necessarily an office) once revenue is consistent.
- Goal: reduce travel friction and win more private Madison work.

### Year 3-5: "Statewide repeat accounts"
- Land 2-3 statewide owner portfolios (property management, hospitality group, senior living operator).
- Build maintenance contracts: quarterly/annual repaint cycles.

### Capability investments (selective)
- Access capability (swing stage training/equipment) if high‑rise exteriors become a consistent lane.
- Traffic marking / striping only after 2-3 profitable pilots.

---

## 6A) Risks / counter‑points (so you don't scale the wrong way)
1. **Diversification dilutes estimating focus** -> Mitigate by limiting to 2-3 new verticals in year 1.
2. **Travel destroys margin** -> Mitigate by tiered geography (Tier 1-3 first; Superior only for specialty).
3. **Union friction / bid environment surprises** -> Mitigate by screening funding source and GC labor posture early.
4. **Public work wage rules could shift** over 5 years -> Mitigate by tracking WI legislative changes and pricing contingencies.

---

## 6B) Scorecard -- how you'll know it's working
- % revenue outside multifamily (target: **+10-15%** within 12 months; **30-40%** by year 5)
- Repeat revenue ratio (target: **>40%** of non‑multifamily from repeat accounts by year 3)
- Gross margin by vertical (track separately; kill lanes that look "busy but broke")
- Estimating hit rate by vertical (optimize where you're actually winning)

---

## 6C) # REVIEW_LEGACY:
- Any legacy approach of chasing volume when Craftmaster bids low (often creates margin stress).
- Any habit of letting integrated drywall/paint firms force you into "lowest number wins" new‑build contests.
- Any one‑off statewide travel job without a repeat‑account path.

---

## Assumptions
- You remain **non‑union** and prefer to minimize union conflict.
- Multifamily remains your **production base** for the next decade.
- You can invest in equipment/training, but only when there is **validated demand**.
- You prefer **private owner / developer** routes and only selectively pursue public work.
