# Flooring Pilot — QC-001 Daily Report Integration
**LaBrant & Associates LLC**  
**Purpose:** Hard-wire flooring pilot controls into the existing Daily QC Report (QC-001) to prevent early-stage failure and weaponized GC friction.

---

## Non-Negotiable Principle
Flooring does **not** get a parallel QC system.
It lives inside **QC-001, QC-002, QC-004/005, and QA-008 (First Floor Gate)**.

If it is not documented in QC-001 with photos, it did not happen.

## QC-001 — Flooring Addendum (Required When Flooring Is Active)

### F1. Flooring Work Summary (Daily)
- Flooring Scope Active Today? (Yes/No)
- Area Installed Today (SF / LF)
- Material Type (LVP Click / LVT Glue / Carpet / Base / Other)
- Rooms / Units / Areas
- Installer Names
- Start Time / Stop Time

### F2. Environmental & Readiness Confirmation (Daily)
- HVAC Operational? (Yes/No)
- Space Conditioned ≥48 Hours? (Yes/No)
- Ambient Temp (AM / PM)
- Relative Humidity (AM / PM)
- Deviations from Spec? (Yes/No + explanation)

**STOP-WORK TRIGGER:** HVAC off or conditions out of range.

### F3. Substrate & Moisture Status
- Moisture Testing Required Today? (Yes/No)
- ASTM Method (F2170 / F1869 / Other)
- Latest Readings
- Within Manufacturer Limits? (Yes/No)
- GC Written Substrate Acceptance on File? (Yes/No)

**If acceptance = NO → INSTALLATION PROHIBITED.**

### F4. Material Control & Dye Lot Tracking
- Manufacturer / Product
- Dye Lot / Batch Number
- Single Lot Verified for Area? (Yes/No)
- Attic Stock Identified & Tagged? (Yes/No)

### F5. Protection & Damage Control (End of Day)
- Floor Protection Installed? (Yes/No)
- Protection Type (Ram Board / Rosin / Other)
- Other-Trade Damage Observed? (Yes/No → QC-004/QC-005)

## Required Photo Sets (Attach to QC-001)

### Photo Set A — Pre-Install
- Substrate condition (wide shot)
- Flatness check (straightedge visible)
- Moisture test setup + reading
- HVAC running / thermostat

### Photo Set B — In-Progress (Daily)
- Active installation
- Packaging showing dye lot
- Adhesive spread or click-lock engagement

### Photo Set C — End of Day
- Completed area
- Protection installed
- Transitions / edges (close-up)

### Photo Set D — Exceptions
- Any deviation, damage, or stop-work condition

---

## First Floor Gate (QA-008) — Flooring Criteria
All must PASS:
- Moisture tests compliant
- Substrate acceptance documented
- Environmental logs clean
- Dye lot control verified
- Zero undocumented scope deviations

Any FAIL = STOP & DIAGNOSE (Owner approval required).

## Internal Enforcement Rule
No QC-001 → No earned value  
No photos → No acceptance  
No acceptance → No install
