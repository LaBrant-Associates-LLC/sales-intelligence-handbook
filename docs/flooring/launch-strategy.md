# FY 2026 Flooring Market Entry & GC Reintroduction Strategy
## LaBrant & Associates LLC | Launch Gameplan

**Document:** LAB-STR-010 | **Date:** December 30, 2024 | **Revision:** 0  
**Classification:** Internal Strategy — Executive Summary

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased strategy for two interconnected but distinct objectives: (1) launching flooring installation services as a new Division 9 capability, and (2) rebuilding relationships with GCs damaged by past execution failures. The strategy recognizes that MSP Real Estate is the only current relationship with sufficient trust to serve as a beta partner for flooring validation, and that approaching burned bridges (McShane, Fiduciary, Nicholas) with a new service offering before addressing the underlying trust deficit would be counterproductive.

**Core Strategic Principle:** Lead with accountability, not capability expansion. Flooring becomes supporting evidence of operational turnaround—not the headline of the reintroduction conversation.

---

## Situation Analysis

### Current State

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| 2026 Backlog | Low — war room blitz underway |
| MSP Relationship | Strong — high trust, validated execution |
| McShane Relationship | Damaged — fraud-related execution failures |
| Fiduciary Relationship | Damaged — requires reintroduction |
| Nicholas Relationship | Damaged — requires reintroduction |
| Flooring Capability | Zero — no references, no trained crews |
| Certification Status | Active DBE/SBE (federal recert in progress) |

### Strategic Problem Statement

LaBrant cannot credibly offer flooring services to new GCs without reference projects. The only GC relationship with sufficient trust to provide beta testing opportunities is MSP. Burned GC relationships require a trust-first reintroduction strategy before any service expansion conversation. Attempting to re-enter damaged relationships by leading with flooring capability will likely be perceived as desperation rather than strategic evolution.

### Market Opportunity

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SE Wisconsin Multifamily Flooring TAM | $6.9M (1,067 WHEDA units) |
| Realistic Year 1 Capture (15-20%) | $560K–$1.0M |
| Competitive Gap | No Milwaukee merit-shop offers painting + flooring package |
| Certification Leverage | DBE/SBE on diversity-required projects |

---

## Strategic Framework

### Two Parallel Tracks

This strategy separates flooring launch from GC relationship repair because they require different approaches, timelines, and messaging.

```
TRACK A: FLOORING CAPABILITY BUILD          TRACK B: BURNED BRIDGE REPAIR
─────────────────────────────────────       ─────────────────────────────────
Q1 2025: Beta validation with MSP           Q1 2025: Internal assessment only
Q2 2025: Build 2-3 reference projects       Q2 2025: Soft outreach (non-sales)
Q3 2025: Soft market signal                 Q3 2025: Accountability conversation
Q4 2025: Public positioning                 Q4 2025: Rebid opportunity pursuit
FY 2026: Full market entry                  FY 2026: Relationship rebuilding
```

### Decision Logic

**Why not lead with flooring when reintroducing to burned GCs?**

Research on contractor-client relationship repair consistently identifies trust, transparency, and demonstrated competency as prerequisites for relationship recovery. Leading with a new service offering to a GC who experienced execution failures creates immediate credibility questions: "If you couldn't execute painting reliably, why would I trust you with more scope?" The flooring capability should be revealed *after* the accountability conversation establishes that operational problems have been addressed.

**Why MSP as the only beta partner?**

Beta testing new services requires a relationship where the GC will provide honest feedback, tolerate minor execution issues during the learning curve, and advocate for you to their project teams despite lack of flooring references. Only MSP currently meets these criteria. Attempting to beta test with damaged relationships compounds the trust deficit if any issues occur.

---

## Track A: Flooring Capability Build

### Phase 1: Controlled Validation (January–March 2025)

**Objective:** Execute 2-3 flooring installations with MSP to validate pricing, processes, and crew capability.

**Approach:** Frame as scope expansion on existing painting contracts, not new service launch. MSP knows LaBrant's execution quality and will provide honest feedback on pricing, sequencing, and crew performance.

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Success Metric |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Contact MSP to discuss flooring scope on pipeline projects | Tyler | Week 1 | Meeting scheduled |
| Complete CFI 2-Day LVP Certification | Designated PM | Jan–Feb | Certificate obtained |
| Procure Tier 2 equipment package | Operations | Week 2-3 | Equipment on-site |
| Verify BYCO certification status | Sales | Week 1 | Certificates in hand |
| Execute subcontractor agreement with certified backup | Tyler | Week 4 | Signed agreement |
| First flooring installation (MSP project) | Field | Feb–Mar | Completed, documented |

**Phase 1 Deliverables:**
- Trained crew with CFI certification
- Equipment inventory established
- Subcontractor relationship formalized
- At least 1 completed MSP flooring project
- Internal cost tracking vs. estimate comparison

**Go/No-Go Decision Point (End of Phase 1):**

| Criterion | Threshold | Decision |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| First project margin | ≥20% | Continue |
| MSP feedback | "Would use again" | Continue |
| Crew execution quality | No callbacks | Continue |
| Cost variance vs. estimate | ≤15% | Continue |

If any criterion fails: Pause Phase 2, address root cause, repeat validation project.

---

### Phase 2: Reference Building (April–June 2025)

**Objective:** Complete 2-3 additional flooring projects to establish reference portfolio. Begin soft market signaling.

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Success Metric |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Execute second MSP flooring project | Field | April | Completed with photos |
| Document project case studies (internal) | Marketing | May | 3 case studies drafted |
| Update website to "Division 9 Interior Finishes" | Tyler | June | Live, no fanfare |
| Soft-mention flooring to WHEDA contacts | Sales | May–June | 5+ conversations |
| Collect MSP reference letter | Tyler | June | Letter in hand |

**Positioning Language (Phase 2):**

Do NOT say: "We're now a flooring contractor."

DO say: "We're expanding our Division 9 capabilities to offer integrated painting and flooring packages. We'd like to understand how you typically scope these trades on your projects."

This framing is honest, forward-looking, and positions the conversation as collaborative discovery rather than a sales pitch for capability you haven't fully validated.

**Website Update Strategy:**

Update positioning to "Division 9 Interior Finishes" rather than "Painting and Flooring Contractor." This reads as strategic evolution of an established company, not a new service line bolted on. Emphasize:

- Comprehensive interior finish packages
- Single-source Division 9 coordination  
- Streamlined closeout through integrated scope

Do not issue press releases or make public announcements during Phase 2.

---

### Phase 3: Market Entry (Q3–Q4 2025)

**Objective:** Full market positioning for 2026 project awards. Make key hire if volume justifies.

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Success Metric |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Publish case studies to website | Marketing | July | 3 case studies live |
| Update LinkedIn company profile | Tyler | July | Capabilities updated |
| Begin including flooring in all multifamily bids | Estimating | Aug+ | Flooring on 50%+ proposals |
| Evaluate field superintendent hire | Tyler | Sept | Decision made |
| Position for 2026 WHEDA awards | Sales | Q4 | 3+ WHEDA developer relationships |

**Key Hire Decision Framework:**

Do NOT hire dedicated flooring field superintendent until:
- Consistently winning flooring scope (3+ projects/quarter)
- Painting project managers are capacity-constrained
- Volume justifies $65K–$85K salary + benefits

Until these conditions are met: Designate existing project manager to own flooring execution. Use subcontractor (BYCO or backup) for installation labor while building self-performance capability.

**Phase 3 Deliverables:**
- 5+ completed flooring projects with documentation
- Public market positioning as Division 9 contractor
- Pricing validated within ±10% of estimates
- Go/no-go decision on key hire

---

## Track B: Burned Bridge Repair

### The Trust Problem

Past execution failures related to internal fraud damaged relationships with McShane, Fiduciary, and Nicholas. These GCs have institutional memory of the problems. Any reintroduction must acknowledge this history directly—attempting to ignore it will fail.

### Relationship Recovery Framework

Research on contractor-client relationship repair identifies these priorities:

1. **Acknowledge the problem** — Don't pretend it didn't happen
2. **Explain what changed** — Demonstrate root cause was addressed
3. **Prove competency elsewhere** — Show current execution quality
4. **Request limited opportunity** — Start small to rebuild trust
5. **Over-deliver** — Execute flawlessly on first re-engagement project

### Phase 1: Internal Assessment (Q1 2025)

**Objective:** Honest evaluation of what went wrong and what has changed.

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Deliverable |
|--------|-------|----------|-------------|
| Document specific failures at each GC | Tyler | Jan | Written summary |
| Identify root causes (fraud, oversight, staffing) | Tyler | Jan | Root cause analysis |
| Document operational changes since failures | Tyler | Jan | Change log |
| Identify current project references (MSP, others) | Sales | Jan | Reference list |
| Prepare accountability talking points | Tyler | Feb | Approved script |

**Do NOT contact burned GCs during Phase 1.** The goal is internal preparation.

---

### Phase 2: Soft Outreach (Q2 2025)

**Objective:** Re-establish contact without sales pressure. Demonstrate continued presence in market.

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Approach |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|
| Attend industry events where GC reps present | Tyler | Apr–Jun | Visibility only |
| Send non-sales communication (industry article, etc.) | Tyler | May | Relationship touch |
| Request informal coffee/lunch meeting | Tyler | June | "Catching up" frame |

**Soft outreach messaging:**

"I know we had some problems on [project]. I'd like to buy you coffee and give you an update on what's changed at LaBrant. No pitch—just wanted to reconnect."

This approach respects the GC's time and acknowledges the history without being defensive.

---

### Phase 3: Accountability Conversation (Q3 2025)

**Objective:** Direct conversation addressing past failures and requesting opportunity to demonstrate improvement.

**Accountability Script Framework:**

> "I want to address what happened on [project] directly. We traced those execution issues to an internal problem we've since addressed [brief explanation]. I know words don't rebuild trust—execution does. If there's ever an opportunity for us to demonstrate where we are now, even on something small, we'd welcome it. In the meantime, we're also expanding into integrated Division 9 packages, including flooring, which I think could create value for your WHEDA pipeline down the road."

**Key elements:**
- Lead with acknowledgment, not excuses
- Explain what changed (briefly)
- Request limited opportunity to prove improvement
- Flooring mentioned as supporting evidence, not headline
- No pressure for immediate commitment

---

### Phase 4: Rebid Opportunity Pursuit (Q4 2025–FY 2026)

**Objective:** Secure small-scope project to demonstrate improved execution.

| Action | Owner | Timeline | Success Metric |
|--------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Request to bid next small project | Tyler | Q4 2025 | Invitation received |
| Submit competitive bid with quality focus | Estimating | As available | Bid submitted |
| Execute flawlessly if awarded | Field | FY 2026 | Zero deficiencies |
| Follow up with GC for feedback | Tyler | Post-project | Feedback documented |

**First Re-Engagement Project Criteria:**

- Prefer small scope ($25K–$75K) to limit risk exposure for GC
- Single building/phase if possible
- Timeline that allows dedicated PM attention
- Budget for over-staffing if needed to ensure quality

**Over-Delivery Strategy:**

On first re-engagement project with each burned GC:
- Daily photo updates to PM
- Weekly written progress reports
- Zero punch list items at substantial completion
- Immediate response to any concerns
- Personal Tyler involvement in closeout

The goal is not profitability on the first project—it's relationship recovery. Budget accordingly.

---

## WHEDA Outreach Integration

### Current Situation

War room calls are actively targeting WHEDA developers and GCs. The question is how to position LaBrant in these conversations given (a) no flooring references yet and (b) some targets may use GCs where relationships are damaged.

### Recommended Approach for WHEDA Calls (Now–Q2 2025)

**For new relationships (developers, GCs without history):**

> "We're a certified DBE/SBE commercial painting contractor with strong multifamily experience. We're also building out integrated Division 9 packages for 2025—I'd like to understand how you typically scope painting and flooring on your WHEDA projects so we can position accordingly when you're selecting subs."

This is honest, signals strategic direction, and positions for follow-up once flooring references exist.

**For relationships involving burned GCs:**

Do NOT attempt to reach developers through burned GC relationships. Instead:
- Target developers who use different GCs
- Build direct developer relationships independent of GC layer
- Revisit burned GC projects only after Track B relationship repair

| Position | Annual Cost | Trigger |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Field Superintendent (Flooring) | $65,000–$85,000 + benefits | 3+ projects/quarter sustained |

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| MSP declines flooring scope | Low | High | Prepare alternative beta path (other trusted GC) |
| First project execution issues | Medium | High | Over-staff, close supervision, subcontractor backup |
| BYCO certification invalid | Medium | Medium | Verify before relying; identify backup sub |
| Burned GCs refuse reintroduction | Medium | Medium | Focus on new relationships; don't force |
| Flooring margin below target | Medium | Medium | Adjust pricing; consider sub-only model |
| Key hire too early | Low | Medium | Strict volume triggers before hiring |
| Market timing (2026 slowdown) | Medium | High | Diversification reduces single-market exposure |

## Appendix A: MSP Conversation Framework

**Objective:** Secure agreement to add flooring scope to upcoming MSP painting contracts.

**Approach:** Position as scope expansion benefiting MSP (single sub for two trades) rather than LaBrant experiment.

**Talking Points:**

1. "We're building out integrated Division 9 capabilities—painting and flooring under one sub."
2. "For your projects, this means one contract, one schedule coordination, one punch list."
3. "We'd like to pilot this on [specific project] if you're open to it."
4. "Our pricing will be competitive with market—we're not asking for a premium."
5. "If it doesn't work out, no hard feelings—we'll stick to painting."

**Anticipated Objections:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "You've never done flooring" | "Correct—that's why we want to start with you. You'll give us honest feedback." |
| "I already have a flooring sub" | "Understood. If there's ever a project where single-source makes sense, keep us in mind." |
| "What if you mess it up?" | "We'll warranty our work. And frankly, we're not going to risk our painting relationship with you over flooring." |

## Appendix B: Accountability Conversation Script (Burned GCs)

**Opening:**

> "Thanks for meeting with me. I wanted to address what happened on [project] directly, because I know it affected how you see LaBrant."

**Acknowledgment:**

> "We had execution problems. I'm not going to make excuses—the work didn't meet the standard you expected, and that's on us."

**Explanation (Brief):**

> "We've since traced those issues to an internal problem that's been addressed. I've made significant operational changes—[1-2 specific examples]."

**Request:**

> "I know words don't rebuild trust. Execution does. If there's ever an opportunity for us to demonstrate where we are now—even something small—we'd welcome it."

**Flooring Mention (Optional, End of Conversation):**

> "Separately, we're also expanding into integrated painting and flooring packages. It's something I think could be valuable for your multifamily pipeline. But that's for down the road—first I'd want to rebuild confidence on the painting side."

**Close:**

> "I appreciate you taking the time. If a bid opportunity comes up where we might be a fit, I hope you'll consider us."

---

## Appendix C: WHEDA Developer Outreach Script

**For developers LaBrant has NOT worked with before:**

> "Hi [Name], this is Tyler LaBrant with LaBrant & Associates. We're a certified DBE and SBE commercial painting contractor based in Milwaukee. I saw that [project name] received WHEDA funding—congratulations on that award."

> "I'm reaching out because we specialize in multifamily interiors, and our certifications can help your GC meet diversity participation requirements. We've completed work with [MSP/other reference] on similar projects."

> "I'd like to understand your timeline and who you're working with on the GC side, so I can make sure we're positioned when subcontractor selection begins."

**If flooring comes up naturally:**

> "We're also building out integrated Division 9 capabilities—painting and flooring together. It's still early for us on the flooring side, but it's something we're developing for 2025-2026 projects."
