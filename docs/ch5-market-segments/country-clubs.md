## Sales Approach

### Initial Contact Script

**Phone/Email to General Manager:**

> "Good morning, I'm [Name] with LaBrant & Associates, a commercial painting contractor serving southeastern Wisconsin. We specialize in private club and hospitality facilities, and I noticed [Club Name] has been making some wonderful improvements to your facilities.
>
> I'd like to introduce our company as a potential resource for your painting and coating needs - whether for upcoming renovations or ongoing maintenance. We understand the importance of minimal member disruption and scheduling work during your off-season.
>
> Would you have 15 minutes to discuss your facility's painting needs, or could you direct me to the appropriate person on your facilities team?"

### Capability Statement Points

For club-specific capability statements, emphasize:

1. **Club/Hospitality Experience** (or comparable high-end commercial)
2. **Off-Season Scheduling Capability**
3. **Phased Work Approach** (minimize disruption)
4. **Quality Workmanship** (not lowest bidder positioning)
5. **Insurance & Safety** (appropriate coverage levels)
6. **Local References** (other clubs or comparable facilities)

### Objection Handling

| "Board decides" | "Would you be willing to share our information with the board, or let me know when they review vendors?" |
| "Not in budget this year" | "When do you typically plan your capital projects? I'd like to stay in touch for future needs" |
| "We use our GC's painter" | "For major renovations, that makes sense. What about maintenance and refresh work between projects?" |
