# Part 1: Municipal Painting Contract Opportunities | Milwaukee 100-Mile Radius
**Date:** 12/22/25 | **Revision:** #0

A commercial painting contractor with DBE (WisDOT), SBE (City of Milwaukee), and Wisconsin DHS lead certification has **substantial competitive advantages** across southeastern Wisconsin's municipal market. With bonding capacity up to $5 million, the company can pursue virtually any municipal painting project in the region. This report identifies **procurement processes, department contacts, certification advantages, and actionable registration steps** across 11 counties and dozens of municipalities within 100 miles of Milwaukee.

## The bidding landscape centers on four key platforms

Nearly all municipal painting contracts in southeastern Wisconsin flow through four primary bidding systems. **Wisconsin VendorNet** (vendornet.wi.gov) is the state's official procurement portal—registration is free at eSupplier.wi.gov and covers state agencies plus many municipalities. **DemandStar** provides free access to Wisconsin Association for Public Procurement (WAPP) member agencies, including Milwaukee County, Racine County, Washington County, Waukesha County (public works), Fond du Lac County, and Dodge County. Register at demandstar.com/app/wapp/registration and select WAPP for complimentary access. **QuestCDN** handles construction documents for cities including Brookfield, New Berlin, Oak Creek, Kenosha, and Oconomowoc. **Bonfire** serves City of Milwaukee, Milwaukee County, Waukesha County (general services), and Walworth County.

For immediate action: Register on all four platforms within one week. Select NIGP commodity codes **910-54** (Painting, Maintenance and Repair Services) and **914-61** (Painting, Building Construction Services) for automatic bid notifications.

## City of Milwaukee offers the strongest certification advantages

The City of Milwaukee represents the largest opportunity in the region, with its SBE program providing measurable bidding advantages. Contractors certified as both **Local Business Enterprise (LBE) and SBE receive a 10% bid preference** on formal competitive bids of $50,000 or more, with a maximum cap of $25,000 above the lowest bid. The city also requires **25% SBE participation** on contracts exceeding $25,000.

**Key registration steps for City of Milwaukee:**
- Create E-Notify account at city.milwaukee.gov/News-Events/enotify for bid notifications
- Register on Bonfire portal at cityofmilwaukee.bonfirehub.com/portal for bid submissions
- Obtain BidExpress Digital ID at bidexpress.com/businesses/936/home for DPW construction projects
- Verify SBE certification status with Office of Equity and Inclusion at 414-286-5553

**Departments with painting needs:**
- **Department of Public Works**: 221 city buildings, bridges, traffic infrastructure, fleet facilities
- **Milwaukee Water Works**: Treatment facilities, pump stations (note: fire hydrants painted in-house)
- **Parks Department**: Pavilions, shelters, recreation facilities
- **Fire Department**: Fire station maintenance across multiple stations
- **Police Department**: Facility maintenance

Contact the Purchasing Division at 200 E. Wells Street, Room 601, Milwaukee, WI 53202. Phone: 414-286-3501. Email: [email protected].

## Milwaukee County doubles down on diversity requirements

Milwaukee County's **Targeted Business Enterprise (TBE) program** sets **25% participation goals for construction projects** and 17% for professional services. The WisDOT DBE certification automatically qualifies as TBE, positioning the company favorably for county work without additional certification steps.

Registration requires four separate systems: **Infor Supplier Portal** for financial transactions, **Bonfire** at countymilwaukee.bonfirehub.com for bid submissions, **E-Notify** for notifications, and **B2GNow** at mke.diversitycompliance.com for diversity compliance tracking. All are free.

**High-value county departments:**
- **Facilities Management Division** maintains county buildings and courthouse complex—Contact Tom Travia at 414-278-4770
- **Department of Parks, Recreation and Culture** manages 15,000+ acres with numerous park structures at 9480 W. Watertown Plank Road, Wauwatosa
- **Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport** has ongoing capital projects requiring painting contractors

The county issues **Time & Material contracts** that include a separate **Contract 5: Painting** category—an ideal recurring opportunity for qualified contractors.

## Major suburban cities each use different procurement approaches

The ten largest suburban cities within commuting distance of Milwaukee present significant but fragmented opportunity. Each uses different procurement systems:

| City | Primary Platform | Key Contact |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Waukesha | Public Purchase (publicpurchase.com) | waukesha-wi.gov |
| Racine | DemandStar | 262-636-9143, purchasing@cityofracine.org |
| Kenosha | QuestCDN/VendorNet | 262-653-4180 |
| West Allis | Vendor Registry (vendorregistry.com) | 414-302-8300 |
| Wauwatosa | City website + QuestCDN | 414-479-8958, tpurchasing@wauwatosa.net |
| Brookfield | QuestCDN | ci.brookfield.wi.us/Bids.aspx |
| New Berlin | QuestCDN | 262-780-4609, jradomski@newberlin.org |
| Greenfield | City website | 414-329-5325 |
| Oak Creek | QuestCDN | oakcreekwi.gov |
| Franklin | City website | franklinwi.gov |

**Brookfield and New Berlin require prequalification**—bidders must submit qualification statements 5 days before bid opening. Prequalification remains valid January through December annually.

**Racine** offers additional advantage through its **Racine Works Program**, which provides local workforce preference. Contact the Purchasing Department at 730 Washington Ave., Room 102, Racine, WI 53403.

## County-level procurement spans 11 counties within reach

All 11 counties within 100 miles of Milwaukee have distinct procurement processes worth monitoring:

**Waukesha County** ($35+ million annual procurement) uses a dual system: Bonfire for general goods/services and DemandStar for public works. Contact: 262-548-7888, purchasing@waukeshacounty.gov.

**Racine County** exclusively uses DemandStar. Contact Duane McKinney, Purchasing Manager, at 262-636-3700 or duane.mckinney@racinecounty.com.

**Kenosha County** is transitioning to Wisconsin VendorNet. Projects over $50,000 require a Vendor Responsibility Questionnaire submitted 5 days before bid due date.

**Washington County** uses DemandStar and advertises in the West Bend Daily News and Daily Reporter. Bidder's Qualification Statement and insurance certificates required.

**Walworth County** uses Bonfire and has **previously issued prequalification RFQs specifically for painting services**—seeking contractors with caulking, sealing, pressure washing, and quality assurance capabilities. This represents a direct prequalification opportunity worth pursuing immediately.

**Fond du Lac County** uses DemandStar. Contact: 920-929-3143, shelby.kapitanski@fdlco.wi.gov.

**Dane County** (Madison area, approximately 80 miles from Milwaukee) uses OpenGov e-Procurement at procurement.opengov.com/portal/countyofdane. Note: Annual registration fee required for bids over $5,000.

**Ozaukee, Dodge, Jefferson, and Sheboygan Counties** have less formalized systems—monitor VendorNet and contact county administrators directly.

## Fire hydrant painting presents selective opportunities

Fire hydrant painting typically commands **$135-$175 per hydrant** for complete sandblasting and two-coat painting. However, research reveals most major municipalities handle this work in-house.

**Municipalities that contract out hydrant painting:**
- **City of Oconomowoc**: ~700 hydrants, last bid March 2023 via QuestCDN (Quest Number 8376476). Contact Josh Wellmann, Water Field Supervisor, at 262-569-3199. Monitor for rebid in 2025-2026 cycle.

**Municipalities with in-house programs (lower priority for direct contracts):**
- **City of Milwaukee** (Milwaukee Water Works): ~20,000 hydrants, 8-10 year cycle, performed by city employees
- **City of Waukesha**: Active 2025 sandblasting program underway. Contact Nick Ellifson at 262-409-4461, nellifson@waukesha-water.com

**Wholesale water customers maintaining their own hydrants** (potential contract opportunities):
Brown Deer, Butler, Greendale, Menomonee Falls, Mequon, New Berlin, Shorewood, Thiensville, Wauwatosa, and West Allis all maintain their own distribution systems and hydrants. Direct outreach to these water utilities may yield opportunities.

**Milwaukee Water Works** serves Greenfield, Hales Corners, and St. Francis directly—these municipalities' hydrants fall under MWW's in-house program.

## Current bid opportunities and seasonal patterns

As of December 23, 2025, **no actively open painting-specific municipal bids** were identified in the 100-mile radius. This reflects typical seasonal patterns—exterior painting work is bid primarily in **February through April** for spring/summer execution.

**Near-term opportunities to monitor:**
- **Milwaukee Public Schools**: Completed $20 million lead paint remediation in 99 schools (contractor: JCP Construction). Phase 2 cosmetic painting expected Spring 2026. Monitor mps.milwaukee.k12.wi.us for solicitations.
- **Seasonal fire hydrant contracts**: Typically advertised February-April
- **County facility maintenance contracts**: Often bundled with painting components

**Additional entities worth monitoring:**
- **Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (MMSD)**: 20% SWMBE participation goal, accepts WisDOT DBE certification. Register at mmsd.diversitycompliance.com.
- **Milwaukee Public Schools**: Register for vendor notifications at mps.milwaukee.k12.wi.us
- **Housing Authority of City of Milwaukee (HACM)**: Contact Kent Britton at 414-286-5863, Kent.Britton@hacm.org. Uses Beacon Bid platform.

## Certification advantages create competitive moats

The company's three certifications provide distinct advantages across different contract types:

**WisDOT DBE certification** applies primarily to federally-funded transportation projects. Important update: As of October 2024, U.S. DOT requires recertification of all DBE firms; WisDOT has temporarily paused setting DBE goals for new contracts. Contact [email protected] for recertification status. However, the certification automatically qualifies as TBE for Milwaukee County projects.

**City of Milwaukee SBE certification** provides the most direct bidding advantage: combined with LBE status, contractors receive **10% bid preference** on contracts over $50,000. The city requires 25% SBE participation on contracts over $25,000—creating subcontracting opportunities if pursuing larger prime contracts.

**Wisconsin DHS lead certification** represents a significant competitive moat. Wisconsin law requires certification for any renovation, repair, or painting in pre-1978 buildings that disturbs more than 6 square feet of interior or 20 square feet of exterior painted surface. Milwaukee's extensive pre-1978 building stock—including schools, municipal buildings, and public housing—makes this certification essential for substantial contract eligibility. Many competitors lack this certification.

**Federal funding triggers:** CDBG-funded projects, EPA-funded water/wastewater projects (through Wisconsin DNR), and HUD-funded housing rehabilitation all require DBE good faith efforts and lead-safe work practices.

## Smaller municipalities require direct outreach

Municipalities under 25,000 population typically use informal quote processes rather than formal bid portals. The most effective approach is direct contact with Department of Public Works directors and Village Administrators.

**Ozaukee County municipalities** (Mequon, Cedarburg, Port Washington, Grafton, Thiensville, Saukville): Most use informal bidding. Mequon and Thiensville purchase wholesale water from Milwaukee Water Works but maintain their own distribution systems.

**Washington County municipalities** (West Bend, Hartford, Germantown, Slinger, Jackson, Kewaskum): County uses DemandStar; individual municipalities typically require direct contact.

**Walworth County municipalities** (Lake Geneva, Whitewater, Elkhorn, Delavan, East Troy): **Lake Geneva requires contractor prequalification by March 15 annually**—submit application early. Contact DPW at 262-248-6644.

**Sheboygan County municipalities** (Sheboygan, Sheboygan Falls, Plymouth, Kohler): City of Sheboygan posts bids at sheboyganwi.gov/departments/finance/project-bids/.

**Wisconsin procurement thresholds** guide when formal bidding applies:
- Under $5,000: Best judgment purchasing
- $5,000-$25,000: Minimum 3 quotes required
- $25,000-$50,000: Informal competitive bids
- Over $50,000: Formal sealed bids with public advertising

## Conclusion

The 100-mile Milwaukee radius contains approximately **150+ municipalities and 11 counties** with potential painting contract opportunities. The company's existing certifications—particularly the City of Milwaukee SBE—provide meaningful competitive advantages that most competitors cannot match. The **10% bid preference** on Milwaukee city contracts and **25% TBE goals** on Milwaukee County construction projects create structural advantages worth pursuing aggressively.

Priority targets should include: City of Milwaukee (highest certification advantage), Milwaukee County (TBE recognition), Walworth County (painting prequalification list), and the dozen suburban municipalities purchasing wholesale water (hydrant painting potential). Registration on DemandStar and VendorNet will capture approximately 70% of formal bid notifications in the region.

The late December timing means few current opportunities exist, but establishing registrations now positions the company for the spring 2026 bidding season when exterior painting and hydrant contracts typically release.
