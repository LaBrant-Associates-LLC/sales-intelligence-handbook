3. **Negative pressure containment** required for lead paint removal on older structures
4. **DBE goals** temporarily paused but expected to resume after federal recertification process
5. **Monthly lettings** occur on 2nd Tuesday - monitor WisDOT letting calendar

## Conclusion

**Strongest Opportunities:**

1. **Racine County Public Safety Building** (135,000 SF, Q4 2026 completion) - Major painting scope, monitor GC selection

2. **Milwaukee County Zoo Front Entrance** ($17M, 2026 construction) - County procurement, TBE goals likely apply

3. **Racine County Behavioral Health Building** (50,000 SF, $15M, September 2026) - Monitor GC selection

4. **Kenosha Fire Station #4** (~$10M, 29,344 SF + training tower) - Contact Fire Department for timeline

**Limited Opportunities:**

- **County Jails:** No major new construction; focus on maintenance painting through county facilities management
- **WisDOT Bridge Painting:** Embedded in larger contracts; requires industrial certifications; pursue through prime contractor relationships (Mashuda)

**Avoid:**

- **Milwaukee Secure Detention Facility:** State DOC project, likely union labor preference
- **Data Centers:** Confirmed 100% union (per Part 2 research)

**Priority Actions:**

1. Register with Mashuda Contractors for WisDOT work
2. Monitor Racine County for two major facility GC selections
3. Build relationship with Milwaukee County Zoo procurement
4. Track Kenosha Fire Station #4 for GC announcement
