## Two-Track Strategy

### Track A: Flooring Capability Build

```
Q1 2025: Beta validation with MSP
Q2 2025: Build 2-3 reference projects
Q3 2025: Soft market signal
Q4 2025: Public positioning
FY 2026: Full market entry
```

### Track B: Burned Bridge Repair

```
Q1 2025: Internal assessment only
Q2 2025: Soft outreach (non-sales)
Q3 2025: Accountability conversation
Q4 2025: Rebid opportunity pursuit
FY 2026: Relationship rebuilding
```

**Strategic Principle:** Lead with accountability, not capability expansion. Flooring becomes supporting evidence of operational turnaround—not the headline of the reintroduction conversation.

---

## Phase 1: Controlled Validation (January–March 2025)

**Objective:** Execute 2-3 flooring installations with MSP to validate pricing, processes, and crew capability.

**Approach:** Frame as scope expansion on existing painting contracts, not new service launch.

| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Contact MSP to discuss flooring scope | Tyler | Week 1 |
| Complete CFI 2-Day LVP Certification | Designated PM | Jan–Feb |
| Procure Tier 2 equipment package | Operations | Week 2-3 |
| Verify BYCO certification status | Sales | Week 1 |
| Execute subcontractor agreement | Tyler | Week 4 |
| First flooring installation (MSP) | Field | Feb–Mar |

### Phase 1 Deliverables

- Trained crew with CFI certification
- Equipment inventory established
- Subcontractor relationship formalized
- At least 1 completed MSP flooring project
- Internal cost tracking vs. estimate comparison

### Go/No-Go Decision (End of Phase 1)

| Criterion | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| First project margin | ≥20% |
| MSP feedback | "Would use again" |
| Crew execution quality | No callbacks |
| Cost variance vs. estimate | ≤15% |

**If any criterion fails:** Pause Phase 2, address root cause, repeat validation project.

---

## Phase 2: Reference Building (April–June 2025)

**Objective:** Complete 2-3 additional flooring projects to establish reference portfolio. Begin soft market signaling.

| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Execute second MSP flooring project | Field | April |
| Document project case studies (internal) | Marketing | May |
| Update website to "Division 9 Interior Finishes" | Tyler | June |
| Soft-mention flooring to WHEDA contacts | Sales | May–June |
| Collect MSP reference letter | Tyler | June |

### Positioning Language (Phase 2)

**Do NOT say:** "We're now a flooring contractor."

**DO say:** "We're expanding our Division 9 capabilities to offer integrated painting and flooring packages. We'd like to understand how you typically scope these trades on your projects."

### Website Update Strategy

Update positioning to "Division 9 Interior Finishes" rather than "Painting and Flooring Contractor." Emphasize:

- Comprehensive interior finish packages
- Single-source Division 9 coordination
- Streamlined closeout through integrated scope

**Do not issue press releases or make public announcements during Phase 2.**

---

## Phase 3: Market Entry (Q3–Q4 2025)

**Objective:** Full market positioning for 2026 project awards.

| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Publish case studies to website | Marketing | July |
| Update LinkedIn company profile | Tyler | July |
| Begin including flooring in all multifamily bids | Estimating | Aug+ |
| Evaluate field superintendent hire | Tyler | Sept |
| Position for 2026 WHEDA awards | Sales | Q4 |

|------|----------------|---------|
| March 31, 2025 | Phase 1 Go/No-Go | Continue / Pause / Pivot |
| June 30, 2025 | Phase 2 Complete | Proceed to Phase 3 |

## Success Metrics

### Track A: Flooring Capability

| Metric | Q2 2025 | Q4 2025 | FY 2026 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Flooring projects completed | 1-2 | 3-5 | 15+ |
| Reference letters | 0 | 1 | 3+ |
| Flooring revenue | $50K | $200K | $500K–$1M |
| Callbacks/warranty claims | 0 | ≤1 | ≤2% |

### Track B: Relationship Repair

| Metric | Q2 2025 | Q4 2025 | FY 2026 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Soft outreach contacts | 3 | 3 | Maintained |
| Accountability conversations | 0 | 3 | 3 |
| Rebid invitations received | 0 | 1 | 2+ |
| Re-engagement projects | 0 | 0 | 1–2 |

## Key Hire Decision Framework

### Do NOT Hire Dedicated Flooring Superintendent Until:

- Consistently winning flooring scope (3+ projects/quarter)
- Painting project managers are capacity-constrained
- Volume justifies dedicated overhead
- Pilot validation complete with proven processes

### Hire Triggers

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| Active flooring projects | 3+ concurrent |
| Quarterly flooring revenue | >$150K |
| PM capacity utilization | >85% |

### Alternative: Sub-Only Model

If volume does not justify dedicated superintendent:

- Continue using trained painting PMs for flooring oversight
- Sub 100% of flooring to BYCO/FLOOR360
- Capture margin on subbed work without overhead

## Burned Bridge Repair: Target GCs

- **McShane Construction** — damaged, fraud-related execution failures
- **Fiduciary Real Estate** — damaged, requires reintroduction
- **Nicholas & Associates** — damaged, requires reintroduction
