## CSI Division 09 Classification

Flooring falls under **CSI Division 09 - Finishes**, the same division as painting. This creates natural scope synergy and simplifies bid package organization.

| Section | Description | LaBrant Relevance |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 09 60 00 | Flooring | **Core flooring scope** |
| 09 65 00 | Resilient Flooring | LVP, LVT, sheet vinyl |
| 09 65 13 | Resilient Base and Accessories | **Vinyl cove base** |
| 09 68 00 | Carpeting | Carpet, carpet tile |
| 09 90 00 | Painting and Coating | **Current core scope** |
| 09 30 00 | Tiling | Ceramic/porcelain (separate trade) |

## Scope Definitions

### What LaBrant Will Self-Perform (Phase 1)

| Product | Self-Perform | Rationale |
|---------|:------------:|-----------|
| LVP/LVT (click-lock) | ✅ | Lowest barrier to entry |
| Vinyl cove base | ✅ | Natural add-on |

### What LaBrant Will Subcontract (Phase 1)

| Product | Subcontract | Rationale |
|---------|:-----------:|-----------|
| LVP/LVT (glue-down) | ✅ | Add in Phase 2 |
| Carpet (broadloom) | ✅ | Specialized equipment, seaming |
| Carpet tile | ✅ | Initially; evaluate Phase 3 |
| Ceramic/porcelain tile | ✅ | Always sub—different trade |

## Vinyl Cove Base Scope

**Industry Standard:** Vinyl cove base is typically flooring contractor scope (Section 09 65 13). The installer of resilient flooring normally installs the wall base.

On new construction multifamily, expect cove base to be part of flooring scope 95%+ of the time. This is a natural add-on when packaging services.

| Attribute | Standard | Premium |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Height | 4" | 6" |
| Material | Vinyl | Rubber (commercial) |
| Style | Cove (floor-to-wall transition) | Cove |

---

## Tile Scope Boundary Warning

**Critical Distinction:** Tile is a separate trade requiring different certifications, ANSI standards, and specialized training.

| Floor Layers | Tile and Stone Setters |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Carpet, LVP/LVT, sheet vinyl | Ceramic, porcelain, marble, granite |

**Recommendation:** Do not attempt to self-perform ceramic/porcelain tile work. Subcontract to qualified tile contractor, manage scope as part of package, capture margin while avoiding liability.
