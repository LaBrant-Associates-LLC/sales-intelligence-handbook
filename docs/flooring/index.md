## Strategic Summary

**Gap Identified:** No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor currently offers both painting AND flooring for multifamily construction.

**Opportunity:** Position LaBrant as "Single-Source Division 9 Finishes" for McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire, and Stevens projects—mirroring how Suburban Drywall packages drywall + painting.

**Certification Advantage:** DBE/SBE status on combined painting + flooring scope increases value on WHEDA and diversity-focused projects.
