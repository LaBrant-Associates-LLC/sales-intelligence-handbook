## Executive Summary

Multifamily and hospitality represent the largest accessible market segment at $10M-$18M annually. Key insight: Wisconsin's multifamily market operates through **regional relationships**, not national vendor procurement systems. Most major national REITs have NO Wisconsin presence--they focus on coastal and Sun Belt markets.

**12-Month Pipeline: $1.6M-$3.0M**
