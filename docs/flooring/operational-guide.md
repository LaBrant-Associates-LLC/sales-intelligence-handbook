## Division 9 Finishes: Scope Classification

Flooring falls under **CSI Division 09 - Finishes**, the same division as painting. This creates natural scope synergy and simplifies bid package organization.

### Division 09 Section Breakdown

| Section | Description | LaBrant Relevance |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| 09 60 00 | Flooring | **Core flooring scope** |
| 09 65 00 | Resilient Flooring | LVP, LVT, sheet vinyl |
| 09 65 13 | Resilient Base and Accessories | **Vinyl cove base** |
| 09 65 16 | Resilient Sheet Flooring | Sheet vinyl (common areas) |
| 09 65 19 | Resilient Tile Flooring | VCT, LVT |
| 09 68 00 | Carpeting | Carpet, carpet tile |
| 09 68 13 | Tile Carpeting | Carpet tile (corridors) |
| 09 68 16 | Sheet Carpeting | Broadloom carpet (bedrooms) |
| 09 90 00 | Painting and Coating | **Current core scope** |
| 09 30 00 | Tiling | Ceramic/porcelain (separate trade) |

---

## Vinyl Cove Base: Scope Assignment

### Industry Standard Practice
**Vinyl cove base is typically flooring contractor scope**, falling under Section 09 65 13 (Resilient Base and Accessories). The installer of resilient flooring normally installs the wall base.

### Exceptions Where Painting May Take Base:
- Small renovation projects where flooring is not being replaced
- When specifically written into painting scope by GC
- Touch-up/replacement on occupied unit turns
- When GC bundles base with painting for scheduling convenience

### Multifamily Standard:
On new construction multifamily (your primary market), expect cove base to be part of flooring scope 95%+ of the time. This is a **natural add-on** when packaging services.

### Typical Cove Base Specifications (Multifamily):
- Height: 4" standard, 6" premium
- Material: Vinyl (rubber base is commercial/institutional)
- Style: Cove (not straight) for floor-to-wall transition
- Colors: Match or complement LVP/carpet

---

## Tile: Scope Boundary Warning

### Critical Distinction
The Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies flooring into two separate occupations:
1. **Floor Layers** — Carpet, LVP/LVT, sheet vinyl, linoleum
2. **Tile and Stone Setters** — Ceramic, porcelain, marble, granite

### What This Means for LaBrant

**Tile is a separate trade requiring:**
- Different certifications (CTI/ACT from CTEF)
- ANSI standards and TCNA Handbook compliance
- Specialized substrate prep (cement board, waterproofing)
- Different insurance classifications
- Years of specialized training

### Recommendation: Subcontract Tile
Do not attempt to self-perform ceramic/porcelain tile work. Instead:
1. Subcontract to qualified tile contractor
2. Manage scope as part of flooring package
3. Capture margin on tile sub while avoiding liability

### Backsplash Question
**Tile backsplashes are tile contractor scope, not flooring.** They require:
- Wall-mounted substrate prep
- Waterproofing behind sink areas
- Thin-set mortar work
- Precision cuts around outlets

This is not finish carpentry scope. Finish carpenters handle wood trim, baseboards, thresholds, and casework—not tile.

## Material Supplier Relationships

### Sherwin-Williams FloorCovering Division

**Important: Different Business Model Than Paint Division**

| Aspect | Paint Division | FloorCovering Division |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Business model | Material supply only | Supply + installation coordination |
| Credit terms | Pay-when-paid available | Flexible terms (verify specifics) |
| Installation | Customer arranges | SW arranges through independent contractors |
| GC relationship | Customer manages | SW can manage if desired |

**SE Wisconsin Location:**
- N16W23390 Stone Ridge Dr, Waukesha, WI
- Phone: 262-549-9007

**Products Available:**
- Carpet (all types)
- LVT/LVP
- Sheet vinyl
- Laminate
- Accessories

**Key Question for LaBrant:** Do you want SW-FC as a material supplier only (you self-perform), or as an installation partner (they find installers)? The latter is their default model but you can likely negotiate material-only supply with contractor terms.

### Nonn's Commercial Division

**Starnet Worldwide Member**

| Location | Phone |
|----------|-------|
| New Berlin | 262-446-6810 |
| Menomonee Falls | 262-255-1400 |
| Madison (Middleton) | 608-442-8100 |

**Services:**
- Material supply
- Dedicated installation crews
- On-site project managers
- PlanGrid technology integration

**Consideration:** Nonn's both supplies AND installs. They could be a competitor or a subcontractor depending on relationship structure.

### Direct Manufacturer Accounts

| Manufacturer | Wisconsin Rep/Contact | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Tarkett | 414-299-0156 (Wauwatosa) | LVT, sheet vinyl, linoleum |
| Shaw Contract | Request via shawcontract.com | Carpet, LVT |
| Mohawk Group | 1-800-554-6637 | Carpet, LVT |
| Mannington | Schmidt Custom Floors (Waukesha) | LVT, sheet vinyl |

## Credit Terms: Paint vs. Flooring Comparison

### Sherwin-Williams Paint (Current Relationship)
- Pay-when-paid terms available
- Net 30-60 standard
- Material rebates based on volume
- Long-standing credit relationship

### Flooring Material Credit (Industry Standard)
- **Net 30-60 typical** — Not pay-when-paid
- Credit application required (new account)
- May require personal guarantee initially
- Trade references checked

**Cash Flow Impact:**
Industry average time to payment for flooring subs: **83 days**

This is significantly longer than painting and requires capital planning. Flooring material is often more expensive than paint per-job, meaning larger working capital requirements.

**Recommendation:** Negotiate terms with existing SW relationship first. Your paint purchase history should provide leverage for favorable flooring terms.

---

## Gotchas & Risk Factors

### Substrate Prep: The Biggest Liability

**Concrete Moisture Testing is Non-Negotiable**

| Test | Standard | Acceptable Reading |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| ASTM F2170 (RH Test) | Industry standard | 75-80% RH or below |
| ASTM F1869 (Calcium Chloride) | Older method | 3-5 lbs/1000 SF/24 hrs |
| ASTM F2659 (pH Test) | Alkalinity check | pH 7-10 |

**Critical Contract Language:**
The GC/owner must provide substrate that meets manufacturer's moisture requirements. If you install over wet concrete and it fails, you own the liability.

**Document Everything:**
- Date and time of testing
- Test method and results
- Photos of test locations
- Who provided testing equipment
- Written acceptance before installation

### Dye Lot Matching

**More Critical Than Paint Batch Matching**

- Different production runs have "drastic" color variations
- Order entire project from same dye lot
- Order 10-15% extra for attic stock
- Returns are restrictive (opened boxes typically non-returnable)

**Recommendation:** Build 5-7% waste factor + 5% attic stock into estimates.

### Temperature Requirements

**Installation Environment Must Be Controlled**

| Phase | Temperature Requirement |
|-------|------------------------|
| Before installation | 65-85°F for 48 hours minimum |
| During installation | 65-85°F maintained |
| After installation | 65-85°F for 48 hours |
| Material acclimation | 48-72 hours in conditioned space |

**New Construction Risk:** HVAC may not be operational. Require written confirmation of climate control before mobilizing.

### Pattern Work Premium

**Herringbone LVT = Your "Vinyl Wallcovering"**

| Pattern | Labor Premium | Waste Factor |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Straight lay | Baseline | 5-7% |
| Diagonal (45°) | +20-30% | 10-12% |
| Herringbone | +40-60% | 12-15% |
| Chevron | +50-70% | 12-15% |
| Custom patterns | +75-100% | 15-20% |

**Installation Difference:**
- Straight lay: Start at wall, work across
- Herringbone: Start at room center, work outward
- Requires precise 45-degree cuts
- Higher skill level required

### Warranty Exposure

**Different From Painting Callbacks**

| Issue | Painting | Flooring |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Visible defect | Touch-up/repaint | Remove and replace |
| Timing | Usually immediate | May surface months later |
| Cause investigation | Straightforward | Complex (moisture, substrate, install) |
| Cost exposure | Material + labor | Material + labor + removal |

**Moisture-Related Failures:**
- Can take 6-12 months to manifest
- Manufacturer will deny warranty if moisture testing not documented
- Flooring may need complete removal
- Substrate remediation before re-install

### Scope Creep Items

**Hidden Scope That Shows Up on Every Multifamily Job:**

1. **Elevator cab flooring** — Often overlooked in initial scope
2. **Model units** — Upgraded materials, faster turnaround
3. **Amenity spaces** — Different material than units
4. **Stairwells** — Carpet + nosings, fire rating requirements
5. **Transition strips** — More than expected at door openings
6. **Closet flooring** — Same SF as unit but additional installation time
7. **Mechanical rooms** — Sheet vinyl or painted concrete
8. **Storage units** — May or may not be in scope
9. **Garage connections** — Transition from exterior to interior
10. **Balcony thresholds** — Weather transitions

## Insurance & Bonding Considerations

### Workers' Compensation

**Flooring may require different classification than painting:**

| NCCI Code | Description | Avg Rate (per $100 payroll) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 5437 | Flooring Installation | $4.05-5.00 |
| 5474 | Painting (interior) | $3.50-4.50 |
| 5478 | Painting (exterior) | $5.00-7.00 |

**Action Required:** Contact your WC carrier to add flooring classification before starting work.

### General Liability

**Completed Operations Coverage is Critical**

Flooring claims can occur 6-12 months after installation (moisture failures). Ensure your GL policy includes completed operations coverage extending at least 2 years.

### Bonding

Your existing $5M bonding capacity should cover flooring work. Verify with bonding company that flooring is covered under existing contractor bond.

## Estimating Checklist for Flooring Bids

### Information Required From GC

□ Floor plans with square footage per room/area  
□ Finish schedule specifying materials  
□ Specification sections (09 65 00, 09 68 00)  
□ Moisture testing responsibility assignment  
□ HVAC completion timeline  
□ Access schedule (when can flooring start?)  
□ Elevator availability for material delivery

### Cost Build-Up

| Line Item | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| LVP material | SF × $/SF × (1 + waste %) |
| LVP labor | SF ÷ productivity × labor rate |
| Carpet material | SF × $/SF × (1 + waste %) |
| Carpet labor | SF ÷ productivity × labor rate |
| Carpet pad | SF × $/SF |
| Tack strips | LF × $/LF |
| Vinyl base | LF × $/LF installed |
| Transitions | EA × $/EA |
| Adhesive | SF ÷ coverage × $/gal |
| Subfloor prep | Allowance or SF × $/SF |
| **Subtotal** | Sum of above |
| Material markup | 15-25% of materials |
| Labor burden | 30-40% of labor |
| Overhead | 8-12% of subtotal |
| Profit | 8-15% of subtotal |
| **Total Bid** | Sum of all |

## Recommended Phased Approach

### Phase 1: LVP/LVT Self-Performance (Months 1-6)

**Start With:**
- Click-lock LVP in units (lowest barrier to entry)
- Vinyl cove base
- Sub out all carpet and tile

**Investment:** $1,500-3,000 equipment + training

**Target:** Offer flooring add-on on 2-3 McShane/Fiduciary jobs in current pipeline

### Phase 2: Add Glue-Down LVT (Months 6-12)

**Expand To:**
- Glue-down LVT in common areas
- Larger flooring scope on projects

**Additional Investment:** Floor roller, adhesive equipment

### Phase 3: Evaluate Carpet Self-Performance (Year 2)

**Only If:**
- Volume justifies equipment investment ($3,000-5,000)
- Can hire or train experienced carpet installer
- Margin improvement over subbing is meaningful

**Consider:** Carpet may remain subbed indefinitely if margin acceptable

### Phase 4: Full Division 9 Contractor (Year 2-3)

**Position As:**
- Single-source Division 9 finishes (painting + flooring)
- Package pricing for multifamily GCs
- Certification leverage (DBE/SBE on full scope)
