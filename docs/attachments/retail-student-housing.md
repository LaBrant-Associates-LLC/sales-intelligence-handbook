A non-union commercial painting contractor in the Milwaukee metro area will find **limited opportunity in data center construction** (dominated by union GCs and PLAs) but **significant potential in major retail developments and student housing renovation**. The Scheels Mayfair project (210,000 SF, opening Spring 2027) and Marketplace of Brown Deer Target store (128,000 SF, opening 2026) represent the largest near-term retail opportunities. This report identifies active projects, verified GCs, and actionable contractor relationships.

## Major Retail Developments

### Scheels at Mayfair Mall (Wauwatosa) - Highest Priority

**The largest near-term retail painting opportunity in southeastern Wisconsin:**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Size** | 210,000 SF (destination retail/entertainment) |
| **Location** | Former Boston Store, 2500 N. Mayfair Road, Wauwatosa |
| **Opening** | Spring 2027 |
| **Developer** | Scheels (employee-owned) + Brookfield Properties (mall owner) |
| **Investment** | Full renovation and expansion |
| **Employment** | 500+ associates (will be one of city's largest employers) |

**December 2025 Update:** The City of Wauwatosa CDA closed on a land transfer agreement with Brookfield Properties on December 19, 2025. Scheels expects to submit site plans and apply for building permits in 2026.

**GC Intelligence - Critical Finding:** Research indicates **Sampson Construction** (Lincoln, Nebraska) is Scheels' primary general contractor nationally. Sampson has built Scheels stores in:
- Lincoln, NE (230,000 SF)
- Johnstown, CO (250,000 SF)
- Springfield, IL (200,000 SF)
- The Colony, TX (331,000 SF - world's largest)
- Sioux Falls, SD (200,000 SF expansion)
- Tulsa, OK (250,000 SF)
- Missoula, MT (108,000 SF remodel)

**Q&D Construction** built the Colorado Springs, CO location (220,000 SF).

**Implication:** If Sampson Construction is selected as GC for Mayfair, they will likely seek local painting subcontractors. Monitor for GC announcement in 2026.

**Interior Painting Scope Considerations:**
- 84 unique specialty shops requiring distinct finishes
- Themed areas (Wildlife Mountain, shooting galleries, sports simulators)
- Restaurant/café spaces (Ginna's Café, Fuzziwig's Candy Shop)
- Entertainment areas (arcade, rollerball)
- Office and back-of-house spaces

**Adjacent Development:** Barrett Lo Visionary Development is planning ~900 apartments adjacent to Scheels on the southern portion of Mayfair (see below).

## Student Housing: Targeted Renovation Opportunity

Unlike UW System projects (state prevailing wage), **private student housing** near Milwaukee universities offers non-union painting opportunity through annual summer turnover repainting.

### The Scion Group - 2040 Lofts (Primary Target)

**The largest private student housing operator near Milwaukee universities:**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Property** | 2040 Lofts |
| **Address** | 2040 W. Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53233 |
| **Owner/Operator** | The Scion Group |
| **Size** | 360+ beds (expanded from original 100 units) |
| **Markets Served** | Marquette, MSOE, MIAD, UWM, AI (Art Institute) |
| **Phone** | (414) 344-2040 |
| **Website** | 2040LOFTS.com |

**The Scion Group Profile:**
- Chicago-based, founded 1999
- Operates 83,000+ beds at 78 campuses nationwide
- Focus on purpose-built urban student housing
- 2040 Lofts was one of their first developments (pioneered the model)

**Summer Turnover Painting Opportunity:**
- Student leases typically end in May
- Unit turnover painting occurs May-August before fall semester
- Common area refresh during low-occupancy periods
- Exterior maintenance during summer months

**Competitive Advantage:** Pre-1978 buildings near campus (common in Milwaukee) require lead-certified contractors - your DHS lead certification is valuable.

**Contact Strategy:**
- Contact property management in January-March to bid summer work
- Propose annual master service agreement for predictable turnover volume
- Emphasize lead certification for pre-1978 buildings

### Other Marquette-Area Student Housing Operators

**Private operators (not university-owned, no state wage requirements):**

| Operator | Properties | Phone | Website |
|----------|------------|-------|---------|
| Wiegand Enterprises | Multiple properties | - | murentals.com |
| Schulhof Properties | Multiple properties | - | schulhofproperties.com |
| Gorman Company | Historic Lofts on Kilbourn | - | gormancompany.com |
| Cedar Square Properties | Various properties | (414) 931-9677 | cedarsquarellc.com |
| Hennessy Group | St. James Court | (414) 350-6601 | hennessygroup.net |
| Sovereign Apartments | Studios, 1 & 2 BR | (414) 933-5553 | - |
| Richter Realty | Studios and 1 BR | (262) 789-2200 | - |
| Nick Buttitta | Studios and 1 BR | (414) 342-1921 | - |
| Feldman Real Estate | Contessa Apartments | - | feldmanrealestate.com |

**The Marq** (2040 W. Wisconsin) is now Marquette-owned and managed by COCM, so may require university procurement processes.

---

### MSOE (Milwaukee School of Engineering)

**Private engineering college - not part of UW System:**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Institution** | Milwaukee School of Engineering |
| **Status** | Private college (no state wage requirements) |
| **Contact** | Residence Life |
| **Phone** | (414) 277-7400 |
| **Email** | living@msoe.edu |

Smaller scale but potentially less competitive. May have direct procurement outside state processes.

---

### UWM Off-Campus Housing

**Private student housing near UW-Milwaukee (not university buildings):**

While UWM campus buildings require state prevailing wage, **off-campus private student housing** does not. The East Side and Riverwest neighborhoods near UWM have significant student housing stock owned by private landlords.

Target property managers (not UWM) for:
- Unit turnover painting (May-August)
- Common area refresh
- Exterior maintenance

---

### Student Housing Strategy Summary

1. **Primary Target:** The Scion Group (2040 Lofts) - largest operator, professional procurement
2. **Timing:** Outreach January-March for summer work planning
3. **Proposal:** Annual turnover contracts with May-August execution window
4. **Differentiator:** DHS lead certification for pre-1978 buildings (most campus-adjacent properties)
5. **Scope:** Unit interiors, common areas, exterior maintenance

## Industrial Construction - Eli Lilly Pleasant Prairie

**Major pharmaceutical expansion with significant painting scope:**

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Company** | Eli Lilly and Company |
| **Location** | 10300 128th Ave., Pleasant Prairie (Prairie Highlands Corporate Park) |
| **Investment** | $3 billion expansion + $1 billion prior acquisitions = $4 billion total WI investment |
| **Jobs** | 750 new permanent + 2,000 construction jobs |
| **Product** | Injectable medicines (diabetes, obesity - includes Mounjaro, Zepbound) |

**Construction Timeline:**
- Construction started: December 2024
- Completion: March 2026
- Production start: Late 2025 (existing facility), 2026 (expansion)

**Phase 1 Additions:**
- Three-story office/manufacturing: 54,166 SF (west side)
- Single-story warehouse: 13,940 SF with 4 dock doors (north side)
- Cafeteria expansion: 2,600 SF
- Parking expansion: 207 spaces

**GC Status:** Not publicly announced. Given scale and pharmaceutical requirements, may use specialized industrial GC. Monitor for subcontracting opportunities.

**Note:** Large pharmaceutical projects often require specialized industrial coating certifications (SSPC QP1/QP2). Painting scope may be limited to office/administrative areas for general commercial painters.

---

## Data Centers: Avoid Entirely

Southeastern Wisconsin has over **$23 billion in announced data center investments**. However, **all major projects operate under Project Labor Agreements with union-signatory general contractors**. There is no painting opportunity for non-union contractors.

### Microsoft Mount Pleasant ($7.3 billion total)

| Phase | Investment | GCs | Labor |
|-------|------------|-----|-------|
| Phase 1 (Fairwater) | $3.3B | Walsh Construction, Kiewit Corp. | 2,300 union construction jobs |
| Phase 2 | $4B (Sept 2025) | Same | Union PLA |

- Operational: Early 2026
- Scale: 1,900 acres, "hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs"
- Microsoft explicitly promotes union construction jobs

### Vantage/OpenAI Port Washington ($15 billion)

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| Investment | $8B Phase 1 ($15B total) |
| GCs | Whiting-Turner, The Weitz Co., Turner/McCarthy JV, Michels |
| Labor | Union PLA confirmed by Milwaukee Building-Construction Trades Council |
| Scale | 672 of 1,900 acres (Phase 1), four data center buildings |

Groundbreaking occurred in late 2025. All four Phase 1 GCs are union-signatory.

### Microsoft Caledonia (Project Nova)

- Investment: Part of $7B+ Wisconsin commitment
- Status: Plan Commission approved 5-2 (September 2025)
- Scale: 245 acres, three data center buildings, 15-acre substation
- Labor: Expected union PLA (same as Mount Pleasant)

### Meta Beaver Dam ($500 million)

- Status: Planned/in permitting
- Labor: Given scale, PLA likely

**Conclusion on Data Centers:** Despite representing the largest construction investment in Wisconsin history, data center projects are **completely inaccessible** to non-union painting contractors. Do not pursue.

---

## Entertainment and Hospitality

### Projects with Union GCs (Avoid)

| Project | Investment | GCs | Status |
|---------|------------|-----|--------|
| FPC Live Deer District venue | $70M, 4,500-capacity | Miron Construction, JCP Construction | Under construction, Fall 2025 opening |
| Milwaukee Rep Theater renovation | $78M | Hunzinger Construction | Through Fall 2025 |

### NCG Hospitality Hotels (Covered in Parts 2-3)

| Project | Rooms | Start | DBE Requirement |
|---------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Moxy Milwaukee Deer District | 156 | Summer 2026 | 25% SBE/DBE + 40% RPP |
| AC Hotel Third Ward | 133 | 2026 | Participation requirements likely |

**NCG Hospitality hotels represent significant opportunity due to 25% DBE goals.** See Part 2 for GC relationship strategy.

## Conclusion

**Data center construction should be avoided entirely** - all Wisconsin projects operate under union PLAs with no painting opportunity for non-union contractors.

**Major retail represents the strongest near-term opportunity:**

1. **Scheels Mayfair** (210,000 SF, Spring 2027) - Monitor for Sampson Construction GC confirmation; substantial interior painting scope across 84 specialty shops and entertainment areas

2. **Marketplace of Brown Deer / Target** (128,000 SF, end of 2026) - Woodsonia Real Estate developing; first major retail in Brown Deer in years

3. **Barrett Lo Mayfair Apartments** (918 units, Phase 1 mid-2025) - Catalyst Construction as GC; 25% DBE requirement directly aligns with certifications

4. **Corners of Brookfield West End** (278 units + 40,000 SF retail, H1 2026) - GC not yet announced; monitor RINKA+/Mandel Group for updates

**Student housing presents targeted renovation opportunity:**
- The Scion Group (2040 Lofts) is the primary target
- Summer turnover painting May-August annually
- DHS lead certification provides competitive advantage

**Priority Actions:**
1. Contact The Scion Group for summer 2026 turnover bidding
2. Research and contact Sampson Construction regarding Scheels Mayfair
3. Build relationship with Catalyst Construction (Barrett Lo GC)
4. Pursue Pepper Construction for Corners of Brookfield work
5. Monitor Woodsonia Real Estate for Brown Deer Target construction
