# Flooring Market Entry: Research Gaps & Market Opportunity Analysis
**LaBrant & Associates LLC**  
**Date:** December 30, 2024 | **Revision:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis addresses four key questions: (1) research gaps in the current project knowledge base, (2) FLOOR360 competitive intelligence, (3) CertaPro's flooring capabilities, and (4) the quantified WHEDA market opportunity with certification stacking benefits. The bottom line: adding flooring to LaBrant's painting package could generate **$560K-$1.3M in incremental annual revenue** from WHEDA projects alone, while making LaBrant significantly more valuable to GCs chasing diversity participation goals.

## Part 1: Project Knowledge Base Research Gaps

After reviewing all project files and working memory, the following areas require additional research before LaBrant can confidently execute the flooring expansion.

### Critical Gaps (Address Before First Flooring Bid)

**1. FLOOR360 Deep Dive - Incomplete**
Current knowledge: Basic company profile, contacts (Matt Nelson, Bob Blake), confirmation they serve multifamily
Missing: Their specific SE Wisconsin project history with your target GCs (McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire, Stevens), their pricing structure, whether they subcontract installation or use employees, their capacity/backlog, financial stability verification

**2. Which Flooring Subs Are Actually Bidding Your GC Projects**
Current knowledge: None
Missing: Bid tabulation data showing which flooring contractors are winning McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire, and Stevens multifamily work—and at what prices. This is the single most important intelligence gap.

**3. Carpet/Tile Subcontractor Vetting for Hybrid Model**
Current knowledge: BYCO identified as potential partner with DBE/SBE/MBE certs
Missing: Verified pricing from BYCO, reference checks, insurance certificates, capacity confirmation. Also need 1-2 backup subcontractors identified and vetted.

**4. Insurance and Workers' Comp Cost Differential**
Current knowledge: NCCI Code 5437 exists for flooring at ~$4.05-5.00 per $100
Missing: Actual quotes from your carrier showing premium impact of adding flooring classification. Need dollar figure before finalizing margin calculations.

### Important Gaps (Address Within 60 Days)

**5. Material Supplier Pricing Verification**
Current knowledge: Sherwin-Williams FloorCovering, Nonn's, Tarkett contacts identified
Missing: Actual material quotes, credit terms confirmation, volume pricing tiers. Need real numbers to build estimating database.

**6. GC Estimator Interviews on Flooring Sub Pain Points**
Current knowledge: Assumption that packaging creates value
Missing: Direct confirmation from McShane, Fiduciary, Stevens estimators about: (a) current flooring sub performance issues, (b) interest in single-source Division 9, (c) how they currently handle diversity participation on flooring scope

**7. Training Provider and Timeline**
Current knowledge: CFI certification exists, manufacturer training available
Missing: Specific course dates, registration deadlines, which employees should attend, training cost totals

**8. Equipment Procurement**
Current knowledge: $1,500-3,000 estimated for LVP startup
Missing: Actual quotes, supplier recommendations, lead times

### Secondary Gaps (Address Within 90 Days)

**9. IOC Construction Milwaukee Presence Analysis**
Current knowledge: Chicago-based, serves Milwaukee, $25-50M revenue, offers painting+flooring
Missing: Their specific Milwaukee property manager clients, project history, pricing reputation, perceived quality

**10. Thomas A. Mason Flooring Pricing**
Current knowledge: They offer flooring as union-only
Missing: Their approximate pricing to understand union/non-union delta in the market

## Part 2: FLOOR360 Competitive Intelligence

### Company Profile

FLOOR360 is larger and more sophisticated than initial research suggested. They represent the primary non-union flooring competitor in the Wisconsin multifamily market.

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 5117 Verona Rd, Madison, WI 53711 |
| Milwaukee Office | 12500 W Silver Spring Dr (opened 2019) |
| Phone | 608-274-2500 (Madison), Milwaukee TBD |
| Founded | 1998 (26+ years) |
| Ownership | Laurie and Bob Tobe (founders); Ryan Koechel (President) |
| CFO | Robert Richter |
| Revenue | **$12.5-15 million** |
| Employees | **56-69 employees** |
| Union Status | Non-union |

### Installation Model: In-House Teams (NOT Subcontractors)

FLOOR360 explicitly states "Installation teams from FLOOR360 have the knowledge and skillsets to complete even the most challenging installations." Their Indeed career page confirms they employ installers directly. This is significant because:

1. They control quality directly (no subcontractor variability)
2. They have scheduling flexibility with employee crews
3. They have invested in training and retention
4. They are NOT a "broker" model like some competitors

### Market Focus Confirmation

Their commercial portfolio page explicitly lists:
- Senior Housing
- Student Housing
- Low Income Housing
- Apartments
- Condominiums
- Resorts/Hotels
- Restaurants/Retail

They completed The Adria apartments in downtown Madison—confirming active multifamily new construction work. They handle certified payrolls, prevailing wage, AIA billing, and have performance bonding capacity.

### Key Contacts for Competitive Intelligence

**Milwaukee Commercial Team:**
- Matt Nelson: mnelson@floor360.com
- Bob Blake: bblake@floor360.com

**Madison Commercial Team:**
- Billy Andersen: bandersen@floor360.com
- Travis Lindhardt: tlindhardt@floor360.com
- Jeff Rathsack: jrathsack@floor360.com

**Corporate:**
- Ryan Koechel, President
- Robert Richter, CFO

### Competitive Assessment

**FLOOR360 Strengths:**
- 26-year track record with proven commercial capability
- In-house installation teams (quality control)
- Milwaukee presence since 2019
- Performance bonding capacity
- Strong residential volume provides cash flow stability
- No DBE/SBE certification identified (potential LaBrant advantage)

**FLOOR360 Weaknesses:**
- Madison-headquartered (60 miles from Milwaukee core)
- No painting capability (cannot offer Division 9 package)
- Milwaukee office is secondary market
- Residential-heavy portfolio may limit commercial focus

**Strategic Implication:** FLOOR360 is a formidable flooring competitor but cannot match LaBrant's potential painting+flooring package. They could also be a subcontractor partner if LaBrant wants to sub flooring initially while building capability.

## Part 3: CertaPro Painters - Flooring Analysis

### Finding: NOT a Soft Flooring Competitor

CertaPro Painters of Milwaukee offers flooring services, but they are limited to **epoxy and polyurea coatings only**—garage floors, industrial floors, pool decks, and patios. This is essentially an extension of their painting/coatings business, not soft flooring.

**What CertaPro Milwaukee Offers:**
- Epoxy floor coatings
- Polyurea floor coatings (Citadel brand)
- Concrete staining
- Garage floor finishing
- Industrial floor coatings

**What CertaPro Milwaukee Does NOT Offer:**
- LVP/LVT installation
- Carpet installation
- Sheet vinyl
- Tile installation
- Any residential/commercial "soft" flooring

### Competitive Implication

CertaPro is NOT competing in the multifamily flooring space. Their flooring offering is industrial/garage coating work—completely different market segment. They remain a competitor only in residential and light commercial painting (they are a franchise broker model, not a direct competitor for commercial construction).

## Part 4: WHEDA Market Opportunity Quantified

### 2025 HTC Awards - Accessible Projects

Based on the WHEDA 2025 Housing Tax Credit awards, LaBrant has potential access to **1,067 units across 13 projects** within the 100-mile service radius.

**Priority 1 Projects (SE Wisconsin + MSP Relationship):**
- 7 projects totaling 674 units
- Includes Bear Development (238 units across 2 Kenosha projects)
- Includes MSP Real Estate (112 units across 2 projects—existing relationship)
- Milwaukee projects with SBE advantage

**Priority 2 Projects (Dane County/Rock County):**
- 6 projects totaling 393 units
- Northpointe Development (115 units across 2 projects)
- Dane County GC landscape may differ from SE Wisconsin

### Market Sizing: Painting vs. Combined Division 9

| Scope | Per-Unit Value | Total Opportunity (1,067 units) |
|-------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Painting Only | $3,000 | $3,201,000 |
| Flooring Only (Workforce) | $3,500 | $3,734,500 |
| **Combined Division 9** | **$6,500** | **$6,935,500** |

### Realistic Capture Scenarios

Assuming competitive bidding and not winning every project, here are revenue scenarios:

| Capture Rate | Painting Only | Flooring Only | Combined | Incremental from Flooring |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------|---------------------------|
| 15% | $480,150 | $560,175 | $1,040,325 | +$560,175 |
| 25% | $800,250 | $933,625 | $1,733,875 | +$933,625 |
| 35% | $1,120,350 | $1,307,075 | $2,427,425 | +$1,307,075 |

**Key Insight:** At a 25% capture rate, adding flooring generates nearly **$1 million in incremental revenue** from WHEDA projects alone—before considering non-WHEDA multifamily work with your existing GC relationships.

## Part 5: Certification Stacking Value Proposition

Your instinct is exactly right. Combining painting + flooring under one DBE/SBE contractor creates multiplicative value for GCs on diversity-focused projects.

### How Certification Math Works

**Scenario: 100-unit WHEDA project in Milwaukee**
- Total construction cost: $25 million
- 25% SBE participation goal: $6.25 million required
- LaBrant painting-only bid: $300,000 (counts toward $6.25M goal)
- LaBrant painting+flooring bid: $650,000 (counts toward $6.25M goal)

**Value to GC:** By awarding both trades to LaBrant, the GC gets **$650,000 toward their $6.25M goal from a single subcontractor relationship** instead of managing two separate certified subs. This reduces their administrative burden while making the participation goal easier to achieve.

### Specific Certification Leverage by Project Type

**Milwaukee City Projects (25% SBE + 10% bid preference):**
- LaBrant's SBE status applies to both painting AND flooring scope
- Combined scope means larger dollar credit toward 25% goal
- 10% bid preference on combined scope provides competitive advantage

**Milwaukee County Projects (25% TBE):**
- DBE = TBE recognition applies
- Same stacking benefit as City projects

**WHEDA-Funded Projects:**
- All 2025 HTC awards have diversity requirements
- Combined scope simplifies GC compliance documentation
- Single subcontractor agreement, single certified payroll, single diversity report

**RPP (Resident Preference Program):**
- If LaBrant hires Milwaukee residents for both trades, the workforce hours count toward RPP requirements
- Combined scope = more opportunities to deploy RPP-qualified workers

### Certification Stacking Summary

From the WHEDA 2025 data:
- **1,012 units** are in projects where DBE certification provides advantage
- **379 units** are in projects where SBE certification provides advantage
- **124 units** are in projects requiring lead certification

On virtually every accessible WHEDA project, LaBrant's certifications create competitive advantage. Adding flooring doubles the dollar value that counts toward GC participation goals.

## Part 6: Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Call FLOOR360 Milwaukee** (Matt Nelson or Bob Blake) under the pretense of exploring subcontractor partnership. Learn their pricing, capacity, and which GCs they work with.

2. **Ask McShane estimator directly:** "Who do you typically use for flooring on your multifamily projects? Are you happy with them?" This answers the critical gap about current flooring sub landscape.

3. **Contact your insurance broker** to get a quote for adding flooring (NCCI 5437) to your workers' comp policy.

### Near-Term (January)

1. **Request meeting with BYCO** (262-894-6995) to explore subcontractor partnership for carpet/tile while you self-perform LVP.

2. **Get material quotes** from Sherwin-Williams FloorCovering (Waukesha) for typical multifamily LVP and carpet.

3. **Identify your first test project** from the current pipeline—ideally a McShane or Fiduciary job where you're already doing painting and can propose adding flooring.

### First Quarter

1. Complete LVP installation training for 2-3 key employees
2. Procure equipment for LVP self-performance
3. Bid first combined painting+flooring package
4. Establish subcontractor agreement with BYCO or alternative for carpet/tile

## Conclusion

The research validates flooring expansion as a high-potential opportunity. FLOOR360 is a capable competitor but lacks painting capability and DBE/SBE certification. CertaPro is not competing in this space. The WHEDA 2025 pipeline alone represents **$3.7M in flooring opportunity**, of which LaBrant could realistically capture **$560K-$1.3M annually** while simultaneously making the company more valuable to GCs through certification stacking.

The critical path forward is closing the intelligence gaps on (1) which flooring subs are currently winning your GCs' work, and (2) verified pricing from potential subcontractor partners. These two pieces of information will determine go/no-go timing and pricing strategy.
