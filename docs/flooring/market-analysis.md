# SE Wisconsin Flooring Market Entry Analysis for LaBrant & Associates
**Date:** December 30, 2024 | **Revision:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Competitive Intelligence for Flooring Services Expansion  
**Market Focus:** Multifamily Construction, SE Wisconsin 100-Mile Radius

---

## Executive Summary

LaBrant & Associates has identified a strategic opportunity to package flooring services with painting in multifamily construction—mirroring how Suburban Drywall packages drywall and painting. Deep competitive research reveals **the SE Wisconsin flooring subcontractor market is fragmented with no dominant non-union player specializing in multifamily.** Union contractors dominate institutional and hospitality work, while the multifamily segment has gaps that a merit-shop painting contractor with flooring capabilities could exploit.

**Key Finding:** Only one regional competitor—IOC Construction (Chicago-based)—currently offers painting + flooring as a package for multifamily. Thomas A. Mason, Wisconsin's largest painting contractor, offers flooring but operates union-only and focuses on institutional work rather than multifamily apartments.

## Competitive Landscape Overview

### Tier 1: Direct Competitors (Painting + Flooring Package)

#### IOC Construction (Inside Out Company)
**Threat Level: HIGH — Your closest business model competitor**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 1425 Paramount Pkwy, Suite B, Batavia, IL 60510 |
| Service Area | Greater Chicago and **Milwaukee Area** |
| Phone | 630-406-3000 |
| Key Contacts | David Lockhart, Tim Ross |
| Revenue | $25-50 million |
| Employees | 51-200 |
| Union Status | Non-union (merit shop) |

**Business Model:** Full-service GC for multifamily capital improvements offering painting, flooring, roofing, and construction services. They explicitly market to property managers for apartment/multifamily facilities, condo/townhome associations, and commercial high-rise.

**Services Include:**
- Painting (interior/exterior)
- Flooring (LVP, carpet, tile, epoxy)
- Roofing
- General construction/renovations
- Property maintenance

**Why They Matter:** IOC is essentially the Chicago version of what LaBrant is considering becoming. They've been serving the Chicagoland and Milwaukee market for 25 years with this integrated model. They target the exact same customer base—property managers and multifamily owners.

**Competitive Advantage Assessment:**
- (+) Established 25-year track record
- (+) Full GC capabilities (roofing, construction)
- (+) Strong technology adoption (JobTread, drone tech)
- (-) Chicago-based, Milwaukee is secondary market
- (-) No DBE/SBE certifications identified
- (-) Larger overhead structure

**LaBrant Opportunity:** Your Milwaukee-local presence, certification advantages (DBE, SBE), and existing GC relationships give you a local advantage IOC cannot match on diversity-focused projects.

#### Thomas A. Mason Painting Company
**Threat Level: MODERATE — Different market segment**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 1501 N. Dr. Martin Luther King Dr., Milwaukee, WI 53212 |
| Phone | 414-271-6688 |
| Founded | 1912 (112 years in business) |
| Employees | 80+ |
| Revenue | $12+ million estimated |
| Union Status | **UNION (IUPAT)** |
| Certifications | MBE, DBE |

**Business Model:** Wisconsin's largest painting contractor with integrated flooring division. Full-service painting and flooring for commercial, institutional, and industrial projects.

**Flooring Services:**
- Ceramic/quarry tile
- Resilient flooring (LVP, linoleum)
- Carpet and carpet tile
- Pre-finished engineered wood
- Vinyl wall covering

**Notable Projects:**
- Milwaukee City Hall ($60M restoration)
- Northwestern Mutual Towers/Commons
- General Mitchell International Airport
- The Trade Hotel (adjacent project)

**Why They're NOT Your Direct Competition:**
1. **Union-only** — Cannot bid merit-shop multifamily projects
2. **Institutional focus** — Government, airports, corporate HQ, not apartments
3. **Price point** — Union labor costs price them out of cost-sensitive multifamily
4. **Relationship base** — Works with union GCs (JP Cullen, Miron, Mortenson)

**LaBrant Opportunity:** Thomas A. Mason proves the painting + flooring model works in Wisconsin. Their union structure creates a massive gap in the merit-shop multifamily market that LaBrant can fill.

### Tier 2: Commercial Flooring Specialists (Flooring Only)

#### Lippert Flooring & Tile
**Threat Level: LOW for multifamily — Union, institutional focus**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | N89 W14260 Patrita Drive, Menomonee Falls, WI 53051 |
| Phone | 262-437-9300 / 262-999-5727 |
| Founded | 1949 (75+ years) |
| Union Status | **UNION (INSTALL certified)** |
| Starnet Member | Yes (premier commercial flooring network) |

**Capabilities:** Full-service commercial flooring including tile, carpet, LVT, resilient, wood, rubber, sports flooring. NTCA Five-Star Contractor. Won awards for The Trade Hotel in Milwaukee (84,000 SF tile).

**Market Focus:** Healthcare, education, corporate, retail, hospitality, government. NOT primarily multifamily apartments.

**Contact:**
- Les Lippert, President
- Jeff Lippert, Executive Vice President

**Why Limited Threat:** Union status and institutional focus. They're bidding Franklin High School, Trade Hotel, and corporate interiors—not the Fiduciary/McShane/Greenfire multifamily projects LaBrant wins.

#### FLOOR360
**Threat Level: MODERATE — Active in multifamily but flooring-only**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 5117 Verona Rd, Madison, WI 53711 |
| Milwaukee Office | Yes (opened 2019) |
| Phone | 608-274-2500 (Madison) |
| Founded | 1998 |
| Union Status | Non-union |

**Milwaukee Contacts:**
- Matt Nelson: mnelson@floor360.com
- Bob Blake: bblake@floor360.com

**Madison Commercial Contacts:**
- Billy Andersen: bandersen@floor360.com
- Travis Lindhardt: tlindhardt@floor360.com
- Jeff Rathsack: jrathsack@floor360.com

**Market Focus:** Explicitly lists "Senior Housing, Student & Low Income Housing, Apartments, Condominiums" in their commercial portfolio. They completed The Adria apartments in downtown Madison.

**Capabilities:**
- Carpet and carpet tile
- LVT/LVP installation
- Tile (through subcontract)
- Certified payrolls, prevailing wage capable
- Performance bonding capacity
- AIA payment applications

**Why They Matter:** FLOOR360 is actively pursuing the same multifamily segment LaBrant targets. However, they offer flooring only—not painting. A packaged painting + flooring solution would compete directly while offering GCs single-source convenience.

**Competitive Consideration:** Could become a subcontractor partner rather than competitor if LaBrant wants to sub out flooring while building capability.

#### Adair Commercial Flooring
**Threat Level: MODERATE — Local SE Wisconsin focus**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | 16601 W Glendale Dr, New Berlin, WI |
| Owner | Tyler Adair (37 years in trade) |
| Founded | Family business, Scott and Laura Werner |
| Phone | Contact via website |
| Union Status | Uses subcontractors (mixed) |

**Manufacturers Carried:** Interface Americas, Shaw Contract, Mannington Commercial, Cambridge Carpets, Nora Rubber, Gerflor Taraflex, Sovereign Stripwood, Armstrong, Johnsonite.

**Concerns:** One Yelp review mentions lien filed for non-payment to subs (2017CL000101, Waukesha County). Verify current financial standing before considering as subcontractor.

**Note:** Separate from Adair Floors N Mor (Franklin, WI) which is residential-focused and a Mohawk ColorCenter dealer.

#### United Flooring Inc.
**Threat Level: MODERATE — Established commercial focus**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | 5260 N. 126th Street, Butler, WI 53007 |
| Phone | 262-783-7171 / 414-586-4164 |

**Capabilities:** Broadloom carpet, tiles, vinyl tile, fitness floors, running tracks, hardwood floors, exotic woods.

**Why Limited Threat for Multifamily:** Union status and institutional focus (schools, hospitals). However, they do serve senior living—an area where LaBrant also has strong GC relationships (Stevens, Greenfire, McShane).

---

#### BYCO Tile and Floor
**Threat Level: LOW — Possible subcontractor partner**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | P.O. Box 148, regional coverage |
| Phone | 262-894-6995 |
| Founded | 1953 (70+ years) |

**Service Area:** Appleton, Beaver Dam, Columbus, Fond Du Lac, Madison, Menomonee Falls, Milwaukee, Monroe, Muskego, Oconomowoc, Oshkosh, Watertown, Waukesha, Waupun, West Bend.

**Why They're Interesting:** BYCO holds the same DBE/SBE certifications as LaBrant. They could be:
1. A subcontractor partner for flooring work
2. A competitor on diversity-focused projects
3. A potential acquisition/merger target

Their MBE certification adds diversity stacking capabilities.

#### Orlandini Flooring Inc.
**Threat Level: LOW — Smaller operation**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | W226N781 Eastmound Dr, Suite B, Waukesha, WI 53186 |
| Phone | 262-522-8060 |
| Founded | 1949 (75+ years) |
| Union Status | **UNION (INSTALL partner)** |

Family business, standard 1-year labor warranty, over 60 years experience. Union status limits competitiveness in merit-shop multifamily.

### Tier 3: Chicago-Based Contractors Serving Wisconsin

#### QuestMark Flooring
**Threat Level: LOW — Industrial/concrete focus**

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Wisconsin Office | Via Chicago office (West Chicago, IL) |

---

#### J&A Carpet Service (Homer Glen, IL)
Listed on Procore as serving Wisconsin. Limited information available. Appears to be carpet-focused.

#### Trevino Flooring LLC (Wheeling, IL)
Serves Wisconsin market per Procore. Focus on residential and commercial flooring including carpet, vinyl, hardwood, tile, stone, rubber, and epoxy.

## Market Gap Analysis

### What the Research Reveals

**Gap 1: No Merit-Shop Painting + Flooring Package Provider**
- Thomas A. Mason offers the combo but is union-only
- IOC Construction offers it but is Chicago-based
- No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor offers both trades

**Gap 2: Fragmented Flooring Subcontractor Market**
- No single dominant player in multifamily flooring
- Many contractors are union (Lippert, United, Orlandini)
- Non-union players are either residential-focused or Madison-based

**Gap 3: Certification Leverage Untapped**
- BYCO is only identified flooring sub with DBE/SBE
- LaBrant's certifications + flooring = unique positioning
- WHEDA projects require diversity participation

**Gap 4: Chicago Contractors Have Logistics Disadvantage**
- IOC Construction (Batavia) is 90 miles from Milwaukee
- Travel time, mobilization costs, local relationships favor Milwaukee-based competitors

---

## Recommended Competitive Strategy

### Position 1: "Single-Source Division 9 Finishes"
Market LaBrant as the only Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor offering both painting AND flooring for multifamily—exactly what Suburban Drywall does with drywall + painting.

### Position 2: Certification Stacking
Combine DBE/SBE status with flooring to increase value on diversity-focused projects. WHEDA, City of Milwaukee, and Milwaukee County projects all have participation requirements that flooring scope helps satisfy.

### Position 3: Target GC Relationships First
Start with existing strong relationships: McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire, Stevens, VJS. Offer flooring as add-on scope to jobs already won for painting.

### Position 4: Differentiate from IOC
- Local presence (Milwaukee vs. Batavia)
- Certification advantages (DBE/SBE)
- Established GC relationships
- Lower overhead structure

## Subcontractor Partnership Opportunities

If LaBrant pursues a hybrid model (self-perform LVP, sub-out carpet/tile), these are potential partners:

| Company | Specialty | Certification | Union | Notes |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------|-------|
| BYCO Tile and Floor | Full service | DBE, SBE, MBE | No | Certification stacking potential |
| FLOOR360 | LVT, carpet | None | No | Active in multifamily, Madison-based |
| Adair Commercial | Full service | None | Mixed | Verify financial standing |

**Avoid for subcontracting:**
- Lippert (union, institutional focus)
- United Flooring (union)
- Orlandini (union)
- Thomas A. Mason (union, competitor)

## Competitive Intelligence Gaps Requiring Further Research

1. **Bid tabulation review** — Which flooring subs are actually bidding McShane, Fiduciary, Greenfire multifamily projects?

2. **GC preference interviews** — Direct conversations with estimators at target GCs about current flooring sub performance and pain points

3. **Pricing benchmarks** — Collect actual bid pricing from recent multifamily projects to establish market rates

4. **IOC Construction deep dive** — Their Milwaukee project history, which property managers they serve, pricing structure

5. **Insurance/bonding verification** — Confirm workers' comp classification codes and GL coverage requirements differ from painting

---

## Action Items

**Week 1-2:**
1. Contact Sherwin-Williams FloorCovering (Waukesha) to establish material relationship
2. Request meeting with BYCO to explore subcontractor partnership
3. Discuss flooring add-on with McShane, Fiduciary on current pipeline projects

**Month 1:**
1. Identify 2-3 flooring subs currently bidding McShane/Fiduciary work
2. Obtain equipment quotes for LVP self-performance
3. Send key personnel to LVP installation training

**Quarter 1:**
1. Bid first flooring package with existing painting scope
2. Establish subcontractor agreements for carpet/tile
3. Add flooring capabilities to GC capability statements
