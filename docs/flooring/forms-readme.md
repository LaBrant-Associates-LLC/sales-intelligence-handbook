## Form Descriptions

### QC-007: Substrate Acceptance Form

**When to use:** Before any flooring installation begins in a new area.

**Key sections:**
- Flatness verification with documented test locations and readings
- Defect documentation (cracks, joints, spalling, residue)
- Moisture status reference to QC-001 test results
- GC acknowledgment with signature

**Critical rule:** No flooring installation may proceed without a signed QC-007 on file for the area. The GC signature transfers substrate risk and establishes the acceptance baseline.

---

### QC-008: Flooring Unit Inspection Checklist

**When to use:** At completion of each unit or area before turnover.

**Key sections:**
- LVP/LVT hard surface criteria (engagement, seams, pattern, expansion gaps)
- Carpet criteria (seams, stretch, pile direction)
- Transitions and base criteria
- Protection and cleanup verification

**Critical rule:** Units with failed inspection items must be corrected and reinspected before release. Document all deficiencies.

---

### QA-008: First Floor Gate v2.1 (Updated)

**When to use:** At first floor completion when flooring scope is active.

**Changes from v2.0:**
- Added flooring-specific gate criteria section
- Flooring criteria include: substrate acceptance, moisture compliance, environmental logs, dye lot control, acclimation documentation, scope deviation check

**Critical rule:** ALL criteria must pass. Any failure triggers stop-and-diagnose with owner approval required to continue.

---

### QC-009: Material Acclimation Log

**When to use:** When flooring materials are delivered to job site.

**Key sections:**
- Material tracking (product, dye lot, delivery date/time, storage location)
- Automatic calculation of earliest install time based on acclimation requirement
- Environmental conditions during storage
- Superintendent verification signature

**Critical rule:** Installation cannot proceed until acclimation period is complete and documented. The form calculates the earliest install date automatically.

---

### QC-001 Flooring Addendum v2 (Updated)

**Changes from v1:**
- Added Photo Documentation section (F6)
- Four required photo sets with specific content requirements
- Photo naming convention standardized
- Clear indication of which fields require photo documentation

**Photo Sets:**
- **Set A (Pre-Install):** Substrate, flatness check, moisture test, HVAC
- **Set B (In-Progress):** Active installation, dye lot packaging, adhesive/click engagement
- **Set C (End of Day):** Completed area, protection installed, transitions
- **Set D (Exceptions):** Any deviation, damage, or stop-work condition

**Critical rule:** No report = no work credit. No photos = no acceptance.

---

### Walk-Away Authority Protocol

**Purpose:** Establishes clear authority for field personnel to halt installation without real-time PM approval.

**Authority levels:**
- **Superintendent:** Full authority to halt for any precondition failure
- **Lead Installer:** Authority to halt and escalate to Superintendent
- **PM:** Authority to resume after corrective action
- **Owner:** Override authority for edge cases

**Eight mandatory stop conditions are documented with specific resume criteria.**

**Critical rule:** Walking away is strength, not failure. Schedule pressure does not override precondition requirements.
