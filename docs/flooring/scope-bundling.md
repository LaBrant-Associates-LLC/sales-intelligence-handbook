# Wisconsin Multifamily Flooring: Scope Bundling & Trade Packaging Analysis
**Date:** December 30, 2024 | **Research Type:** Deep Web Research  
**Question:** Is flooring bundled into finish carpentry? Are roofers packaging flooring? What are the bundling patterns?

---

## Executive Summary

Deep web research reveals **four distinct scope bundling patterns** in the Wisconsin multifamily market. The critical finding for LaBrant: **flooring IS bundled with other trades, but the specific combinations vary by contractor type**. QBC bundles flooring with carpentry (not painting). Suburban Drywall bundles painting with drywall (not flooring). Thomas A. Mason bundles painting with flooring (but is union-only). IOC Construction—a Chicago-based roofer—bundles roofing, painting, AND flooring and actively serves Milwaukee.

**Key Strategic Insight:** No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor currently bundles painting + flooring together. This gap represents LaBrant's opportunity.

## Finding #1: Yes, Flooring IS Bundled with Finish Carpentry

### QBC (Quest Building Corp) — DeForest, WI
**Bundled Scopes:** Rough Carpentry + Finish Carpentry + Cabinetry + Countertops + **Flooring** + Materials Supply

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 7,500 SF office + 27,000 SF fabrication shop, DeForest WI |
| Service Area | Dane County, Madison, Milwaukee, Fox Valley, Northern IL |
| Founded | 1998 |
| Union Status | **Merit shop (non-union)** |
| Project Range | $50,000 tenant rehabs to $115M+ multifamily |
| Revenue | Not disclosed, but 27 years operating, 450-unit developments |

**Their Value Proposition:** "Managing multiple subcontractors creates coordination chaos and schedule risk. QBC eliminates the chaos by bundling your labor and materials under one contract, one schedule, and one point of accountability."

**Key Clients:** Stevens Construction Corp., Forward Management, McGann Construction, Fried & Associates, DSI Real Estate Group, 1848 Construction

**What They DO NOT Do:** Painting. QBC is carpentry + flooring, NOT flooring + painting.

**Implication for LaBrant:** QBC validates the market demand for bundled scopes but represents a complementary model, not direct competition. A GC could hire QBC for carpentry/flooring and LaBrant for painting—OR hire LaBrant for painting + flooring as an alternative single-source Division 9 finishes provider.

## Finding #2: Yes, Roofers DO Bundle Flooring

### IOC Construction — Batavia, IL (Serves Milwaukee)
**Bundled Scopes:** Roofing + Painting + Flooring + Siding + Construction Services

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 1425 Paramount Pkwy, Suite B, Batavia, IL 60510 |
| Phone | 630-406-3000 |
| Service Area | Greater Chicago AND **Milwaukee Area** |
| Founded | ~1990 (35 years in business) |
| Union Status | **Non-union (merit shop)** |
| Revenue | $9.5 million (ZoomInfo) to $25-50M (project knowledge) |
| Employees | 51-200 |
| Key Contacts | David Lockhart, Tim Ross |

**Service Mix:**
- Interior & Exterior Painting
- **Roofing** (commercial, multifamily)
- **Flooring** (LVP, carpet, tile, epoxy)
- Siding and Trim
- Facade Replacement
- Property Maintenance
- Interior Build-outs

**Target Market:** Property managers, apartment/multifamily facilities, condo/townhome associations, commercial high-rise, HOAs

**Why They Matter:** IOC is exactly what LaBrant is considering becoming—a multi-scope contractor serving property managers with painting + flooring + additional services. They prove the model works. However:
- They're Chicago-based (90 miles from Milwaukee)
- No DBE/SBE certifications identified
- Larger overhead structure
- Milwaukee is their secondary market

**This is the clearest example of a roofer that also does flooring.** Their business evolved from painting → construction → roofing → flooring → full-service GC for multifamily renovation.

## Finding #3: Painting + Drywall Bundle (No Flooring)

### Suburban Drywall — Waukesha/Lake Mills, WI
**Bundled Scopes:** Drywall + Insulation + Metal Framing + **Painting** + Millwork + Acoustic Tile

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | Waukesha & Lake Mills, WI |
| Founded | 1978 |
| Union Status | Merit shop (implied by GC testimonials) |
| Revenue | $47.7 million (2025) |
| Employees | 200+ |
| Ownership | Private equity backed (AVALT, VantEdge Partners acquired 2022) |

**Service Evolution:**
- 1978: Founded as drywall
- 1999: Added insulation
- 2002: Added painting and staining
- 2009: Added light-gauge steel studs

**What They DO NOT Do:** Flooring. Suburban is drywall + painting, not painting + flooring.

**Key Client Quote:** "Suburban Drywall is one of our most trusted partners and their involvement adds a significant level of certainty to the potential success of the project." — Jonathan Koch, Stevens Construction Corp.

**Implication for LaBrant:** Suburban demonstrates that expanding from one trade to complementary trades works at scale ($47M revenue). They went drywall → insulation → painting. LaBrant could go painting → flooring.

## Finding #4: Painting + Flooring Bundle (Union Only)

### Thomas A. Mason Company — Milwaukee, WI
**Bundled Scopes:** Painting + Wood Finishing + Special Coatings + **Flooring** (ceramic, resilient, carpet, engineered wood)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Headquarters | 1501 N Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr, Milwaukee |
| Founded | 1912 (112 years) |
| Phone | (414) 271-6681 |
| Union Status | **UNION ONLY** (IUPAT painters + Carpenters) |
| Revenue | $12M+ (company), $21.6M (ZoomInfo 2025) |
| Employees | 80+ union trades workers |
| Certifications | **DBE, MBE, SBE, HUB, WHEDA, Lead Abatement** |
| Service Areas | Wisconsin AND Colorado |

**Full Service Mix:**
- Painting (interior/exterior)
- Wood finishing
- Vinyl wall covering
- Special coatings
- Ceramic/quarry tile
- Resilient flooring (LVP, linoleum)
- Carpeting
- Pre-finished engineered wood flooring

**Why They're Relevant But Not Direct Competition:**
Thomas A. Mason is the ONLY identified Wisconsin contractor bundling painting + flooring. However, their union-only labor model means:
- Higher labor costs than merit-shop competitors
- Limited compatibility with merit-shop GCs (Stevens, Greenfire, McShane, VJS)
- Focus on institutional/municipal work (schools, libraries, fire stations)
- Less competitive on private multifamily where merit-shop dominates

**Certifications Advantage:** Their DBE/MBE/SBE certifications give them advantages on public/diversity projects—similar to LaBrant. But their union status limits private sector competitiveness.

## Answer to Specific Questions

### Is flooring packaged into finish carpentry scopes in Wisconsin multifamily?
**YES.** QBC explicitly bundles finish carpentry + flooring + cabinetry + countertops under one contract. This is their primary business model and they've handled 450-unit multifamily developments. The logic: these are sequential scopes on the construction schedule, same GC relationship, material supply synergies.

### Are there any roofers that do flooring or bundle flooring another way?
**YES.** IOC Construction (Batavia, IL) bundles roofing + painting + flooring and actively serves the Milwaukee market. They evolved from painting contractors to full-service property management renovation company. This is the clearest example of non-traditional scope bundling.

### Is flooring bundled into finish carpentry?
**Yes, but separately from painting.** The Wisconsin market shows two distinct bundling patterns:
1. **Carpentry + Flooring** (QBC model) — No painting
2. **Painting + Flooring** (Thomas A. Mason model) — No carpentry, union-only

No Wisconsin contractor currently bundles painting + carpentry + flooring together.

## Strategic Implications for LaBrant

### The Market Gap (Confirmed)
- QBC does carpentry + flooring but NOT painting
- Suburban does drywall + painting but NOT flooring
- Thomas A. Mason does painting + flooring but is UNION ONLY
- IOC does painting + flooring but is CHICAGO BASED

**No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor offers painting + flooring together.**

### Competitive Positioning Options

**Option A: Mirror QBC Model**
Position as Division 9 Finishes contractor bundling painting + flooring. Differentiate from QBC by offering painting (which they don't) and from Thomas A. Mason by being merit-shop (which they're not).

**Option B: Mirror IOC Model**
Position as property management renovation contractor with painting + flooring + other services. Target the same customers (property managers, multifamily operators) with local Milwaukee presence advantage.

**Option C: Complementary to QBC**
Partner with QBC where they do carpentry/cabinets/countertops and LaBrant does painting + flooring. Joint proposals to GCs for complete Division 9 coverage.

### GC Preference Research Needed
The key unknown: Do GCs prefer:
- Single-source Division 9 (one sub for carpentry + flooring + painting)?
- Specialized subs (separate flooring sub, separate painting sub)?
- Flexible packaging (willing to combine if offered)?

Direct interviews with estimators at Stevens, McShane, Greenfire needed to validate.

*This analysis confirms the flooring market opportunity identified in earlier research. The scope bundling patterns validate that contractors successfully package multiple Division 9 trades. LaBrant's proposed painting + flooring model has market precedent (Thomas A. Mason, IOC) but would be unique as the only Milwaukee-based merit-shop option.*
