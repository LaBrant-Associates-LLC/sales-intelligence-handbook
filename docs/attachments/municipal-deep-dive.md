## Conclusion

The 100-mile Milwaukee radius contains approximately **150+ municipalities and 11 counties** with potential painting contract opportunities. The combination of DBE (WisDOT), SBE (Milwaukee), and DHS lead certification positions a contractor for virtually all municipal painting opportunities in the region, with bid preferences and participation goals creating measurable competitive advantages.

**Fire hydrant painting is NOT a viable municipal opportunity** - 20 of 21 surveyed utilities handle this work in-house. Only Oconomowoc contracts out, representing ~700 hydrants every 3 years.

**Priority Targets:**
1. **City of Milwaukee** - Highest certification advantage (10% bid preference + 25% SBE goal)
2. **Milwaukee County** - TBE recognition (25% construction goal)
3. **Milwaukee Public Schools** - Phase 2 cosmetic painting ($5-15M estimated)
4. **MMSD** - 22%+ SWMBE utilization exceeds goals
5. **HACM** - Section 3 requirements favor local certified firms

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Complete all platform registrations by January 15
2. Submit prequalification paperwork by January 31
3. Contact MPS Procurement about Phase 2 timeline
4. Monitor water tower RFPs in January-March
5. Build GC relationships for subcontracting opportunities

The late December timing means few current opportunities exist, but establishing registrations now positions the company for the spring 2026 bidding season when exterior painting and cosmetic school contracts typically release.
