**Status:** Controlled Pilot Only | **Next Review:** March 31, 2025

## Why This Chapter Exists

This chapter governs LaBrant's entry into flooring. It exists for one reason: to ensure that expanding into flooring does not compromise the discipline, documentation, and trust that define our painting operation.

Flooring introduces a materially different risk profile than painting. Failures are often latent, responsibility is frequently contested after the fact, and correction typically requires removal and replacement rather than repair. Because of this, flooring cannot be approached as a casual scope addition.

**This chapter is authoritative.** All flooring-related decisions—bids, pilot selection, execution standards, and GC conversations—are governed by the doctrine contained here.

## The Strategic Case (Summary)

**Market Gap:** No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor currently bundles painting + LVP/carpet flooring for multifamily construction. [See full analysis →](strategy.md)

**Certification Leverage:** DBE/SBE status on combined scope doubles GC participation credit on WHEDA and municipal projects.

**Revenue Opportunity:** The 2025 WHEDA pipeline alone represents $6.9M in combined Division 9 opportunity. At 25% capture, flooring adds ~$934K incremental revenue. [See market sizing →](market-opportunity.md)

## The Competitive Landscape (Summary)

| Competitor | What They Do | Gap |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| Thomas A. Mason | Painting + flooring | **Union-only** |
| IOC Construction | Painting + flooring | **Chicago-based** (90 mi) |
| FLOOR360 | Flooring only | No painting, no certs |
| QBC | Carpentry + flooring | No painting |
| Suburban Drywall | Drywall + painting | No flooring |

## The Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **One pilot project at a time.** No parallel flooring projects until post-install review is complete.

2. **No installation without documented acceptance.** Substrate, moisture, environment, and scope must be confirmed in writing before work begins.

3. **Walk-away authority is mandatory.** If preconditions fail, we do not install. Schedule pressure does not override readiness.

4. **Flooring lives inside QC-001.** No parallel QC system. If it's not documented with photos, it didn't happen.

5. **Failure of any gate halts the strategy.** This is not an obligation to scale—it's permission to try under strict controls.
