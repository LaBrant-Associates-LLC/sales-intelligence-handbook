# Part 2: GC Landscape & Non-Union Market Segments | SE Wisconsin
**Date:** 12/22/25 | **Revision:** #1

---

A non-union commercial painting contractor in the Milwaukee metro area has significant opportunities in specific market segments and with identified open-shop general contractors. Approximately 80% of Wisconsin's construction workforce operates in the merit-shop environment according to ABC Wisconsin, though union dominance persists on public K-12 schools, government buildings, and major institutional projects. This report identifies which GCs to pursue, which to avoid, and the market segments offering the strongest non-union painting opportunities.

## General contractors classified by labor affiliation

The most critical factor for avoiding union conflicts is understanding which general contractors are merit-shop (open to non-union subs) versus union-signatory. This classification determines job site accessibility more than project type alone.

### Confirmed merit-shop GCs to pursue

**Stevens Construction Corp.** stands out as the premier partner for non-union painting contractors. Their website explicitly promotes a "Merit Shop Philosophy," and they've received ABC Wisconsin Safety Awards. Based in Madison with a Milwaukee office at 1134 N 9th Street (414-828-5100), Stevens specializes in multifamily apartments, senior living, and hospitality--all excellent painting segments. With 300+ employees and $1 billion in construction over five years, they represent high-volume opportunity. Business development contact: Matt Hartenstein.

**Catalyst Construction** explicitly states on their website: "Instead of being bound by union rules, we get to choose the best contractors for each aspect of your project." This 100% employee-owned firm at 833 E. Michigan Street (414-727-6830) has positioned itself as Wisconsin's largest school and church builder--specifically private and religious schools, not public districts. They dominate healthcare construction for smaller facilities including the Orthopaedic Hospital of Wisconsin, Ascension Medical Center Mequon, and Rogers Behavioral Health facilities. CEO Matt Burow and Senior Director John Richter lead development.

**Greenfire Management Services** operates competitively, bidding all work regardless of union affiliation. As the construction arm of Forest County Potawatomi, they're minority-owned and work extensively with diverse subcontractors. Located at 3215 W. State Street (414-290-9400), Greenfire handles hospitality (Potawatomi Casino Hotel), multifamily, and commercial projects. Their relationship with Mandel Group creates ongoing opportunity. **Currently bidding J Jeffers Mitchell Multifamily project** -- contact Seth Coronado at seth.coronado@greenfire.com.

| Merit-Shop GC | ABC Member | Primary Markets | Milwaukee Contact |
|---------------|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Stevens Construction | ✓ | Multifamily, Senior Living, Hospitality | 414-828-5100 |
| Catalyst Construction | -- | Churches, Private Schools, Healthcare | 414-727-6830 |
| Greenfire Management | -- | Hospitality, Multifamily, Commercial | 414-290-9400 |

**WDS Construction** in Beaver Dam (920-356-1255) has won multiple ABC Safety Awards and builds nationally for retail brands including Dick's Sporting Goods and Cobblestone Hotels. **Riley Construction** in Kenosha (262-658-4381) self-performs concrete, carpentry, and masonry while focusing on healthcare, pharmaceutical, and industrial projects across SE Wisconsin and Northern Illinois.

### Union-signatory GCs to avoid

**JP Cullen** has been explicitly union since 1904. CEO David Cullen states publicly: "We have been a union company since trade unions were formed in the Midwest." Their Milwaukee office in Brookfield handles K-12 public schools, government buildings, and major institutional work. They appear on the Milwaukee Building & Construction Trades Council signatory contractor list.

**Mortenson Construction** executed a Project Labor Agreement with Milwaukee Building Trades for the Fiserv Forum and operates under PLAs on major sports and entertainment venues. Their Brookfield office at 17975 Sarah Lane should be avoided.

**C.D. Smith Construction** is confirmed signatory, appearing on the Milwaukee Building Trades Council list. Their partnership with JP Cullen on the $420 million Baird Center expansion exemplifies their union-labor focus. They've completed the Bradley Symphony Center ($139M) and numerous school referendum projects. Note: C.D. Smith recently left the Neutral.Edison mass timber tower project mid-construction due to cost overruns--project currently paused.

**Miron Construction** employs 1,200+ union craftspeople and states on their website that they're "signatory to the trades we self-perform." Federal court records confirm their membership in the Wisconsin Chapter of Associated General Contractors' multi-employer bargaining association with construction trade unions.

| Union-Signatory GC | Evidence | Typical Projects |
|--------------------|----------|------------------|
| JP Cullen | Explicit since 1904; Trades Council list | Public K-12, Government, UW System |
| Mortenson | Fiserv Forum PLA; Trades Council list | Sports venues, Data centers |
| C.D. Smith | Trades Council list; School referenda | Convention centers, Schools, Symphony |
| Miron | 1,200+ union craft; Court records | UW projects, Packers work, Entertainment |
| The Boldt Company | Multi-trade signatory | Healthcare, Government, Industrial |
| J.H. Findorff | Trades Council list; $1.6B in schools | K-12 referenda, UW-Madison |
| Hunzinger Construction | Self-performs union concrete/carpentry | Deer District, Schools, Government |
| CG Schmidt | Trades Council list | K-12, Healthcare, Institutional |
| Scherrer Construction | School referendum specialist | K-12 public schools, Municipal |

### GCs requiring case-by-case evaluation

**VJS Construction Services** in Pewaukee presents a mixed profile. They complete extensive work in senior living, religious facilities (200+ churches), and private education--typically non-union segments. However, they also handle Milwaukee County projects and appear affiliated with AGC, which negotiates union contracts. Approach VJS for private sector work but verify requirements on each project.

**CMR Construction** in Franklin specializes in multifamily, student housing, and senior living across SE Wisconsin. They market themselves as Wisconsin's top condo and apartment builder. Worth investigating labor practices on specific projects.

## Market segments ranked by non-union opportunity

Based on the research, certain segments consistently use merit-shop labor while others are dominated by union requirements. The client's certifications (DBE-WisDOT, SBE-City of Milwaukee, lead certification, aerial/swing stage capability) and $5 million bonding capacity position them well for mid-sized commercial projects across these segments.

### Tier 1: Excellent non-union opportunity

**Senior living and assisted living** ranks as the strongest segment. VJS Construction has completed facilities for St. Camillus, St. Francis Convent, and numerous CCRCs with merit-shop labor. Capri Communities/Tarantino & Company operates 43 communities across SE Wisconsin--the largest portfolio in the state--creating ongoing renovation and new construction demand. Contact Kristin Ferge at (262) 798-1224 or info@capricommunities.com. Active projects include a 119-unit Tukka Properties development in Waukesha and the $40 million Artalia Bayside in Bayside. Typical senior living projects run $15-50 million with significant interior painting scope.

**Religious institutions** are overwhelmingly non-union. Catalyst Construction dominates this segment alongside VJS's 200+ completed church projects. The $10.1 million Church of the Gesu renovation near Marquette is underway now (completing November 2025), with raSmith as architect. Scherrer Construction completed Divine Mercy Chapel in South Milwaukee. Churches are budget-conscious and often welcome competitive non-union bids.

**Private and parochial schools** differ fundamentally from public school referendum projects. HOPE Christian Schools works exclusively with Catalyst Construction. VJS Construction is currently expanding St. Augustine Preparatory Academy to 123,000 SF (2,400 students) and Bruce Guadalupe Community School. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee, WELS Lutheran Schools, and Missouri Synod Lutheran Schools represent extensive private school networks with ongoing facility needs.

**Light industrial and warehouse** development is booming along the I-94 corridor. Uline just opened Wisconsin's largest warehouse (1.44 million SF) in Kenosha and has a $129 million, 1.2-million-SF expansion in permitting. HSA Commercial is building 918,844 SF at Highland Commerce Center of Somers and 550,647 SF at Bristol Highlands--among Wisconsin's largest speculative industrial buildings. Berghammer Construction in Racine specializes in industrial and is active in Milwaukee, Racine, and Kenosha counties. Interior painting scope covers offices, break rooms, and corridor systems.

**Self-storage facilities** use almost exclusively non-union contractors. Milwaukee added 87,000 SF of storage space in 2024 (2.7% inventory growth). Wauwatosa Self Storage is converting the former MGIC building on W. State Street. Construction costs run $25-70/SF with painting covering office areas and climate-controlled unit corridors.

### Tier 2: Good non-union opportunity

**Healthcare (non-hospital systems)** provides strong opportunity through Catalyst Construction's dominance. They've built the Ascension Medical Center Mequon (29,896 SF), Orthopaedic Hospital of Wisconsin Glendale (42,000 SF), Children's Midtown Primary Care Clinic, and the Corridor Medical Office Building Brookfield (50,000 SF). Irgens develops medical office with Catalyst as GC--Mayfair Medical Commons (45,823 SF, completed July 2024) and Stone Ridge Medical Commons (58,223 SF conversion) are recent examples. A Pewaukee medical office development with Phase 1 at 35,000 SF and Phase 2 at 20,000 SF is in planning. Avoid major hospital system construction (Froedtert, Aurora, Ascension system hospitals) which typically uses union GCs.

**Hospitality** offers moderate opportunity, concentrated outside downtown Milwaukee. The Moxy Milwaukee Downtown (156 rooms, $50M) near Fiserv Forum targets July 2026 groundbreaking through NCG Hospitality. NCG projects require **25% SBE/DBE participation**--aligns directly with the client's certifications. Hotel Laureum (35 rooms, boutique luxury) begins construction January 2026. WDS Construction builds Cobblestone Hotels; Wieser Brothers handles Holiday Inn Express properties. Restaurant build-outs and smaller hotel renovations are particularly accessible.

**Automotive dealerships** require regular renovations to meet manufacturer brand standards (every 7-10 years). Rosen Automotive Group, Amato Auto Group, and numerous single-point dealerships across Milwaukee, Waukesha, and Kenosha counties represent opportunities. These privately-owned businesses typically seek competitive pricing without union requirements.

### Tier 3: Selective opportunity

**Retail and shopping centers** have shifted from large mall development to strip centers and tenant build-outs. The 58-acre Granville Station (former Northridge Mall) will complete demolition fall 2025, opening for industrial, commercial, and housing development. OneNorth in Bayside continues development. Tenant improvement work is typically non-union, but larger retail developments vary.

**Private office buildings** are size-dependent. Large downtown towers (Northwestern Mutual North Office $500M renovation) use union labor. Suburban office construction and tenant improvements are more accessible. The office-to-residential conversion trend (100 East Building, 37 stories) may open renovation opportunities.

### Segments to avoid

**Public K-12 schools** are dominated by JP Cullen, Findorff, C.D. Smith, CG Schmidt, and Scherrer--all union signatories. School referendum projects require union labor.

**Government and municipal buildings** often operate under Project Labor Agreements.

**Major hospital system construction** for Froedtert, Aurora, and Ascension typically uses union GCs.

**Sports and entertainment venues** like Fiserv Forum and the American Family Amphitheater required PLAs.

## Conclusion

The southeastern Wisconsin construction market offers substantial opportunity for a non-union commercial painting contractor who understands the GC landscape. **Stevens Construction, Catalyst Construction, and Greenfire Management Services** represent the highest-priority GC relationships to develop--all three are merit-shop and active in strong painting segments.

**Senior living, religious institutions, private schools, and light industrial** present the best segment opportunities with consistent non-union labor practices. The client's SBE and DBE certifications create competitive advantage on projects with participation goals, particularly NCG Hospitality's hotel developments.

**Avoid** public K-12 schools, government buildings, major hospital system projects, and sports/entertainment venues where union GCs and PLAs dominate.

ABC Wisconsin membership provides the primary platform for relationship development. SuperCon 2026 in February represents the best near-term networking opportunity to meet GC leadership and project managers across the merit-shop community.
