**Version:** 2025-12-25  
**Purpose:** Planning-level market $ sizing and a segment map to guide 12‑month diversification + 5‑year growth in Wisconsin (no IL/MN).  
**Notes:** No images included. Dollar figures are ranges and should be refined with your bid log + win rates.

## 1A) Wisconsin construction "macro" baseline (source-backed anchors)

### Construction value and major drivers (statewide)
- **Total value of construction in Wisconsin (2024): ≈ $19.2B** (ConstructConnect, via WI Construction Impact Report).  
- That 2024 growth was described as being driven by a **large jump in non-residential**, with **office (including data centers)** a major contributor to the year-over-year increase.  
- **Residential permits (2024): 23,727 units**, up year-over-year; **~54% single-family / ~46% multifamily** (units basis).

### Nonresidential spending (statewide)
- **Private nonresidential spending in Wisconsin (2024): ≈ $7B**  
- **State & local spending (2024): ≈ $7B**  
(AGC WI fact sheet; totals not available there for residential and certain other categories.)

## 1B) Market sizing model for commercial painting/coatings in WI (TAM -> SAM)

### What we mean by "market" here
For strategy decisions, the most useful view is **$ that owners/GCs spend on painting + industrial protective coatings** in:
- Multifamily (new + turns + exteriors)  
- Private nonresidential (new + TI + repositioning)  
- Industrial maintenance / asset protection (plants, equipment, tanks, structural steel)  
- Select municipal/county work **only where union / prevailing-wage friction is manageable**

We **exclude**: DIY/homeowner retail painting, and we treat heavy union-heavy civil as **low-addressability**.

### A practical two-bucket sizing approach
Because publicly available datasets don't cleanly separate "painting on new builds" vs "repaint/maintenance," we size in two parts:

#### Bucket 1 -- NEW construction + major renovation painting (easier to anchor)
**Private nonresidential new/major reno paint scope (WI):**
- Anchor: **$7B** private nonres spend (2024).  
- Typical paint scope on commercial building projects (planning range): **~1.5%-2.5%** of total project value.  
- Implied annual paint scope: **$105M-$175M** (private nonres only).

**Multifamily new paint scope (WI) using permits as a proxy:**
- Anchor: **23,727** total residential permits in 2024; **~46% multifamily** ⇒ **~10,900 multifamily units**.  
- Interior paint-only planning range: **$2,500-$5,000 per unit** ⇒ **$27M-$55M**.  
- Add common areas + exterior complexity (planning uplift **+20%-40%**) ⇒ **≈ $32M-$77M**.

**Planning take:** Bucket 1 (new + major reno) for private nonres + multifamily is **~$140M-$250M+** annually in WI (order-of-magnitude).

#### Bucket 2 -- REPAINT + maintenance + industrial asset coatings (harder to anchor, but critical)
Repaint/maintenance is often **at least comparable** to new-paint volume in mature markets because:
- interiors cycle every ~5-7 years (units/common areas)  
- exteriors cycle ~7-12 years (weather + substrate)  
- industrial assets (steel, equipment, tanks) have ongoing corrosion-control needs

**Planning range:** Bucket 2 is often **~1.0× to 2.5× Bucket 1** for commercial/multifamily/industrial scopes combined (varies with interest rates, new-build cycle, and facility capex).

**Implied repaint/maintenance market (WI):** **≈ $140M-$625M**.

### Total addressable "commercial + multifamily + industrial coatings" spend (WI)
**Planning TAM (statewide): ≈ $280M - $875M per year**  
- Lower end = conservative repaint factor + conservative paint scope %  
- Upper end = more repaint-heavy / maintenance-heavy environment

### SAM filters for your business reality (non-union + private-first)
To convert TAM -> SAM (serviceable addressable market), discount for:
- projects where union-only rules or union GC requirements block entry  
- prevailing wage / public procurement friction  
- scopes packaged with drywall where pricing is structurally compressed (unless you can sell direct or differentiate on schedule/quality)

A reasonable planning assumption for **SAM = ~40%-70% of TAM** (statewide), depending on how aggressively you pursue private owners + repeat maintenance.
- **SAM planning range (WI): ≈ $110M - $610M/year**

## 1C) Segment map with planning $ ranges (statewide WI)

**Important:** These ranges are slices of the TAM above, not additive "new money." Use them to prioritize segments by (1) size, (2) union friction, (3) margin, (4) repeatability.

| Segment | What you sell | Union friction (planning) | Planning $ size (WI) | Why it matters |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| **Multifamily - turns + repositioning** | unit turns, corridor/common repaint, exterior repaints | Low-Medium | **$80M-$200M** | Relationship + schedule-driven; less commoditized than new-build low-bid if you win property mgmt trust |
| **Multifamily - new build** | full interior/exterior painting | Medium | **$30M-$80M** | Still your foundation; protect share while competitors "buy volume" |
| **Private industrial / manufacturing maintenance** | corrosion-control, equipment/steel, shutdown work | Low-Medium | **$60M-$200M** | Higher barrier (safety, coatings know-how). Less drywall-bundling pressure |
| **Warehouses / logistics / self-storage** | fast-build interiors, metal building exteriors, maintenance | Low | **$30M-$120M** | Private owners; speed/coverage matters; repeat portfolios possible |
| **Hospitality (hotels)** | exterior repaints, room refresh cycles, common areas | Low-Medium | **$20M-$90M** | Fits your "big exterior repaint" credibility (Hyatt example) |
| **Retail + tenant improvements (TI)** | quick-turn interiors, rollouts, brand refresh | Low | **$20M-$80M** | Great filler work; can build repeat accounts with regional operators |
| **Private healthcare + senior living** | occupied-space repainting, infection-control compliant practices | Medium | **$30M-$120M** | Can be sticky work; qualification-driven; some systems lean union--target independents |
| **Municipal/county (select)** | buildings, tanks, small facilities | High variance | **$20M-$100M** (but low capture%) | Opportunistic only where procurement/prevailing wage doesn't create constant friction |
| **Traffic markings (optional expansion)** | striping + lot markings | Medium-High | **$20M-$80M** | Often public-facing and price-driven; can be worthwhile if you target private lots/warehouses and bundle with repaint scopes |

## 1D) "Smart" implications (what these numbers mean for your next decisions)

### 12-month (near-term) diversification thesis
1. **Stop treating "commercial painting" as one market.**  
   Your real moat is in segments where **repeat maintenance** + **coatings competence** matter more than low-bid volume.
2. **Shift the pipeline mix so multifamily is the base, not the whole pie.**  
   A practical target: **multifamily = 60-70% of revenue** (still foundation), and **30-40% from 2-3 add-on verticals**.
3. Pick "add-on verticals" that (a) are private-first, and (b) don't hand advantage to drywall-packagers:
   - industrial maintenance/coatings  
   - hospitality exteriors + refresh cycles  
   - warehouse/logistics/self-storage portfolios

### 5-year (scale) thesis
- **Win portfolios, not projects** in 2-3 segments: property mgmt groups, regional hotel owners, industrial operators, logistics developers.
- Build **one specialty capability** that competitors won't chase when they're buying volume (e.g., corrosion-control + complex coatings + safety program depth).

## Appendix A -- Sensitivity checks (how to sanity-check the sizing quickly)
Use these 3 knobs to see if the estimate is directionally right for your reality:
1. **Private nonres paint % of spend:** 1.5% vs 2.5%  
2. **Multifamily $/unit paint:** $2.5k vs $5k, plus 20-40% for common/exterior  
3. **Repaint factor:** repaint/maintenance = 1.0× vs 2.5× new-build paint scope

If your internal last-24-month closed revenue + competitor quotes suggest different unit economics, recalibrate these knobs and the ranges update immediately.
