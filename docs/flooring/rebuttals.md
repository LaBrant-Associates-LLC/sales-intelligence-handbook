# Flooring Expansion Research Validation Pack (Deep Web Rebuttals)
**Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Scope:** Systematically validate or deny claims made in the four uploaded documents using external web evidence.  
**Method:** Each major claim is tagged **VALIDATED / CONTRADICTED / PARTIALLY VALIDATED / UNVERIFIED** with cited evidence (Chat citations in this workspace).

# REVIEW_LEGACY: The *same* WHEDA sizing + certification-stacking narrative is repeated across all four documents. Consider consolidating into one “Market Opportunity Appendix” and referencing it everywhere else to prevent future drift.

---

## 1) Rebuttal — `SE_Wisconsin_Flooring_Market_Entry_Analysis_for_LaBrant_and_Associates.md` (Rev 1.1)

### 1A. WHEDA market sizing and project counts
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| “2025 WHEDA Housing Tax Credit awards … 13 projects … 1,067 accessible units” | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED / UNVERIFIED SUBSET** | WHEDA’s *total* 2025 HTC awards are **27 developments / 1,731 units** (official summary). | The document’s “13 projects / 1,067 units” may be a *filtered subset* (e.g., within 100-mile radius, “accessible” to your geography/relationships), but the filtering logic is **not shown**. Without the filter criteria + list, the 13/1,067 figures are **not externally verifiable** as stated. |
| “2025 4% awards: $10,591,203 Federal + $6,902,938 State, 8 projects, 774 units” | **VALIDATED** | WHEDA 2025 4% award list states exactly these totals and 774 units. | This section is strong; it matches WHEDA’s published totals. |
| “2025 9% awards: (implied as part of total) …” | **VALIDATED (totals), but NOT the doc’s subset numbers** | WHEDA 2025 9% award list states **$19,157,556** awarded to **19 projects** supporting **967 total units** (957 affordable). | Your memo should distinguish **total awards** vs **your serviceable subset**. |

### 1B. Competitor profiles — IOC Construction
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| IOC exists and offers painting + flooring and other services | **VALIDATED** | IOC’s website lists flooring and painting among services. | Valid. |
| IOC HQ address “1425 Paramount Pkwy, Suite B, Batavia, IL 60510” and phone “630-406-3000” | **VALIDATED** | IOC “Contact Us” page lists that address + phone. | Valid. |
| IOC serves Milwaukee area and markets multifamily | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | IOC LinkedIn describes service to “Greater Chicago and Milwaukee Area” and multifamily experience. | “Milwaukee is secondary market” remains **interpretive** unless supported by job history / office presence evidence. |
| “Key contacts David Lockhart, Tim Ross” | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | Industry directory listing includes those names associated with IOC. | Treat as *lead intelligence*, not authoritative corporate leadership roster. |

### 1C. Competitor profiles — Thomas A. Mason
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Thomas A. Mason offers painting + flooring | **VALIDATED** | Company site states painting and flooring services. | Valid. |
| “80+ union painters and floor coverers” / union workforce | **VALIDATED** | Company site states “80+ union painters and floor coverers”; local reporting supports union workforce framing. | The “union-only” claim is directionally supported, but the specific union affiliation (IUPAT) was **not independently confirmed** in the sources pulled here. |
| “Not your direct competition due to union + institutional focus” | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | Sources confirm union workforce and broad commercial profile. | Their market mix (institutional vs multifamily) is **not proven** by a public portfolio breakdown in the evidence gathered; treat as a hypothesis to verify via bid tabs / GC interviews. |

### 1D. Competitor profiles — FLOOR360
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Milwaukee office address: 12500 W Silver Spring Dr | **VALIDATED** | FLOOR360 Milwaukee page lists the address. | Valid. |
| Madison address: 5117 Verona Rd | **VALIDATED** | FLOOR360 Madison page lists the address. | Valid. |
| “In-house installation crews (NOT subcontractors)” | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | FLOOR360 job postings include “in-house carpet installer.” | This supports employee installers exist. It does **not** prove all trades are in-house or that tile is always subbed. |
| “Revenue $12.5–15M; employees 56–69” | **CONTRADICTED / UNVERIFIED** | Public estimate sites show different figures (e.g., Growjo estimates ~$20.8M and ~72 employees). | Revenue/headcount are **not reliably confirmable** from authoritative public filings. This section needs either (a) a defined methodology, or (b) to be rewritten as “estimated” with a range and source confidence. |

### 1E. CertaPro “not a soft flooring competitor”
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Milwaukee CertaPro “flooring” offering is epoxy/polyurea coatings | **VALIDATED** | CertaPro Milwaukee pages market epoxy/polyurea floor coatings and related concrete coating services. | This supports the conclusion that their “flooring” is coatings-focused. |
| “CertaPro does NOT offer LVP/carpet installation” | **UNVERIFIED (absence-of-evidence)** | Sources captured show coatings pages; no evidence found of LVP/carpet installation. | Absence-of-evidence is not proof. The safer statement is: “Primary marketed flooring services are coatings; no marketed evidence found for LVP/carpet install.” |

## 2) Rebuttal — `Flooring_Market_Entry_Operational_Guide.md` (Rev 1.1)

### 2A. Division 9 classification and scope boundaries
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flooring and painting both sit under CSI Division 09 (Finishes) | **VALIDATED (industry standard)** | CSI MasterFormat places both under Division 09. | Widely accepted; not controversial. (Not re-cited here because primary CSI docs weren’t pulled in this pass.) |
| “Vinyl cove base is typically flooring scope” | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | This is common practice, but was not validated with a published spec or trade standard in the sources pulled. | Recommend adding 1–2 authoritative references (spec language from typical Division 09 65 13 sections, or a standard spec reference) to harden this. |
| “Do not self-perform tile; separate trade with different standards” | **VALIDATED (risk logic), but NOT formally sourced here** | — | The risk framing is correct; formal validation would cite TCNA/ANSI standards and licensing/trade norms. (This can be added in the next research pass.) |

### 2B. Pricing benchmarks, labor rates, productivity
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Installed cost ranges (LVP, carpet, sheet vinyl, base) | **UNVERIFIED** | — | These numbers may be realistic, but this pass did not locate authoritative SE-WI price benchmarks. To validate, we’d need: supplier quotes, RSMeans location factors, or published bid tabs. |
| “Industry avg time to payment for flooring subs: 83 days” | **UNVERIFIED** | — | This is a high-impact financial claim; needs a source (trade association survey, credit bureau construction payment index, etc.). |
| ASTM moisture testing thresholds listed | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | — | ASTM defines methods, not universal thresholds; thresholds are typically manufacturer-specific. The guide should clarify “example ranges; confirm per manufacturer spec.” |

### 2C. Insurance codes and rates (NCCI 5437)
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| NCCI code 5437 for flooring installation | **UNVERIFIED in this pass** | — | Likely correct, but needs an authoritative citation (NCCI/manual excerpt or insurer documentation). Rates vary heavily by carrier, mod, and payroll mix; publish as “illustrative.” |

## 3) Rebuttal — `Flooring_Painting_Operational_Synergies.md` (Rev 1.1)

### 3A. “Transferable disciplines” (QC, substrate inspection, AIA billing)
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environmental monitoring parallels between paint + flooring | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | — | The concept is right; however, flooring tolerances frequently require **documented substrate moisture testing** beyond ambient logs. Your synergy section correctly flags this later—just ensure it’s not perceived as “ambient logs are enough.” |
| AIA billing similarity | **VALIDATED (process logic)** | — | This is operationally true, but not a claim that requires external validation. |

### 3B. New disciplines list (moisture, flatness, dye lot, acclimation)
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| FLOOR360 uses in-house installers (implication: higher competitor capability) | **PARTIALLY VALIDATED** | Job postings explicitly advertise “in-house” installer roles. | Supports “they have employee crews,” but not the full depth of the commercial bench. |
| “2025 WHEDA timeline aligns with Q1–Q4 2025 bid timing” | **VALIDATED (program dates)** | WHEDA program page lists key cycle dates incl. award announcement “May 2025.” | Dates are validated; your internal execution timeline is plausible. |

## 4) Rebuttal — `Flooring_Research_Gaps_Market_Opportunity_123024.md` (Rev 1.1)

### 4A. Research gaps (meta-claims about what’s missing)
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| “Which flooring subs are bidding your GC projects is unresolved” | **VALIDATED (as a gap)** | — | This is exactly the right gap; the web cannot solve it reliably—bid tabs + estimator interviews will. |
| “Insurance/WC premium impact is unresolved” | **VALIDATED (as a gap)** | — | Correct; must come from your carrier/broker. |

### 4B. FLOOR360 profile (re-stated)
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| Addresses and phone numbers | **VALIDATED** | FLOOR360 Madison + Milwaukee pages list addresses; Madison phone listed. | Good. |
| “No DBE/SBE certification identified” | **UNVERIFIED (negative claim)** | — | This is a *negative assertion*. To validate, you’d need to check Wisconsin DOT DBE directory / City of Milwaukee SBE listings / County TBE rosters and cite the search result method. |

### 4C. CertaPro “gap closed” conclusion
| Claim | Status | Evidence | Notes / Rebuttal |
|---|---|---|---|
| “CertaPro is coatings only; not soft flooring” | **VALIDATED (directionally)** | CertaPro Milwaukee markets epoxy/polyurea and related coating services as their flooring offering. | The conclusion is reasonable, but phrase it as “marketed offering” unless you confirm with an explicit “we do not install LVP/carpet” statement. |

# Priority Fix List (What to change in the source documents before you rely on them)

1. **Separate WHEDA totals vs your subset**: Add an appendix table listing the exact 13 projects and how “accessible/serviceable” was defined. Otherwise the 13/1,067 claim is not defensible against WHEDA’s published totals. (WHEDA totals: 27 developments / 1,731 units.)  
2. **Downgrade FLOOR360 revenue/headcount to “estimates” with confidence**: Right now the memo presents precise numbers that conflict across public estimate sources. Keep the business implications, remove faux precision.  
3. **Convert negative certification claims into directory-checked facts**: “No DBE/SBE identified” needs a repeatable lookup method + citation.  
4. **Source high-impact financial benchmarks**: “83 days to payment” and similar numbers must be sourced or removed.  
5. **Clarify ASTM thresholds**: ASTM defines methods; thresholds are manufacturer-specific. Present thresholds as examples and require spec confirmation.
