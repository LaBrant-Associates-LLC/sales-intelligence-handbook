## Operational Synergies with Painting

Many of the controls required for successful flooring execution already exist within LaBrant's painting operation. Flooring introduces new rigor that strengthens painting execution rather than diluting it.

### Transferable Painting Disciplines (10 Items)

| Discipline | How It Transfers |
|------------|------------------|
| **Environmental Monitoring** | Daily QC reports already capture RH and temperature. Same 65-85°F range applies to flooring. |
| **Substrate Inspection** | Crews already inspect walls for defects. Same mindset applies to floor substrates. |
| **Surface Preparation** | Patching, priming protocols translate to concrete prep, self-leveling compound. |
| **Protection of Adjacent Work** | Painters already mask and protect flooring. Flooring installers protect walls. |
| **Material Storage** | Climate-controlled storage, FIFO inventory—plus acclimation time for flooring. |
| **AIA Billing** | G702/G703 payment applications, progress tracking—identical for flooring. |
| **Finish Trade Coordination** | Already coordinating with drywall, trim, MEP. Flooring fits same sequence. |
| **Punch List Process** | Photo documentation, touch-up scheduling, warranty tracking—nearly identical. |
| **Safety & OSHA** | OSHA 10, safety meetings, PPE, hazcom—adds flooring-specific hazards only. |
| **Change Order Management** | Scope tracking, pricing, documentation—same process. |

### New Flooring Disciplines Required (10 Items)

| Discipline | What's New |
|------------|-----------|
| **Formal Moisture Testing (ASTM)** | F2170 or F1869 testing with documented thresholds, not just ambient RH. |
| **Subfloor Flatness Standards** | 3/16" variance max over 10 feet. Requires straightedge, documentation. |
| **Dye Lot Management** | Single lot for entire project. Visible variation if mixed—unlike paint batches. |
| **Material Acclimation** | 48-72 hours in conditioned space before installation. |
| **Pattern Layout** | Herringbone/diagonal starts at room center, not wall. |
| **Transition Strip Selection** | T-moldings, reducers, stair nosings—material-specific. |
| **Adhesive Working Time** | Glue-down requires understanding open time and set time. |
| **Seaming Techniques** | Sheet vinyl and carpet require field seaming—no painting equivalent. |
| **Floor Protection Enforcement** | Specify requirements for other trades, document conditions at turnover. |
| **Warranty Registration** | Many manufacturers require formal registration with documented testing. |

## Why Flooring Is Higher Risk Than Painting

Flooring is treated internally as a **latent, binary, reputation-risk trade.**

### Failure Mode Comparison

| Issue | Painting | Flooring |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Visible defect | Touch-up/repaint | Remove and replace |
| Timing | Usually immediate | May surface months later |
| Cause investigation | Straightforward | Complex (moisture, substrate, install) |
| Cost exposure | Material + labor | Material + labor + removal |

### The Single Fatal Failure Mode

> **Allowing flooring installation to proceed without documented, written precondition acceptance.**

This includes:
- Moisture
- Substrate flatness
- Environmental readiness
- Scope clarity

**One exception = one potential project-ending event.**

## Moisture Testing Requirements (ASTM)

| Method | Description | Typical Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| ASTM F2170 (In-Situ RH) | Preferred method | 75-85% RH maximum |
| ASTM F1869 (Calcium Chloride) | Older method | 3-5 lbs/1000 SF/24 hrs |
| ASTM F2659 (pH Test) | Alkalinity check | pH 7-10 |

**Critical Contract Language:** The GC/owner must provide substrate that meets manufacturer's moisture requirements. If you install over wet concrete and it fails, you own the liability.

### Documentation Requirements

- Date and time of testing
- Test method and results
- Photos of test locations
- Who provided testing equipment
- Written acceptance before installation

---

## Temperature & Acclimation Requirements

| Phase | Temperature Requirement |
|-------|------------------------|
| Before installation | 65-85°F for 48 hours minimum |
| During installation | 65-85°F maintained |
| After installation | 65-85°F for 48 hours |
| Material acclimation | 48-72 hours in conditioned space |

**New Construction Risk:** HVAC may not be operational. Require written confirmation of climate control before mobilizing.

**Synergy Note:** If the space fails paint specs, it will fail flooring specs too.

---

## Dye Lot Matching Risk

**More Critical Than Paint Batch Matching:**

- Different production runs have "drastic" color variations
- Order entire project from same dye lot
- Order 10-15% extra for attic stock
- Returns are restrictive (opened boxes typically non-returnable)

**Recommendation:** Build 5-7% waste factor + 5% attic stock into estimates.

---

## Scope Creep Items

**Hidden scope that shows up on every multifamily job:**

1. Elevator cab flooring — Often overlooked in initial scope
2. Model units — Upgraded materials, faster turnaround
3. Amenity spaces — Different material than units
4. Stairwells — Carpet + nosings, fire rating requirements
5. Transition strips — More than expected at door openings
6. Closet flooring — Same SF as unit but additional installation time
7. Mechanical rooms — Sheet vinyl or painted concrete
8. Storage units — May or may not be in scope
9. Garage connections — Transition from exterior to interior
10. Balcony thresholds — Weather transitions

## Insurance & Bonding

### Workers' Compensation

| NCCI Code | Description | Avg Rate (per $100 payroll) |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------------|
| 5437 | Flooring Installation | $4.05-5.00 |
| 5474 | Painting (interior) | $3.50-4.50 |
| 5478 | Painting (exterior) | $5.00-7.00 |

**Action Required:** Contact your WC carrier to add flooring classification before starting work.

### General Liability

**Completed Operations Coverage is Critical.** Flooring claims can occur 6-12 months after installation (moisture failures). Ensure your GL policy includes completed operations coverage extending at least 2 years.

### Bonding

Your existing $5M bonding capacity should cover flooring work. Verify with bonding company that flooring is covered under existing contractor bond.
