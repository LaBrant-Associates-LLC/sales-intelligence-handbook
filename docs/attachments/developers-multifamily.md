# Part 3: Multifamily Pipeline, Developers & Financing Outlook | SE Wisconsin
**Date:** 12/22/25 | **Revision:** #0

Milwaukee's multifamily market is entering a **supply-constrained period** that creates opportunities for painting subcontractors positioned with the right developer and GC relationships. New apartment construction is projected to decline 40-50% from 2024 levels—the lowest since 2015—while demand remains robust at 96% occupancy. This tightening market means fewer but more competitive projects, with financing increasingly contingent on affordable housing tax credits and TIF assistance where SBE/DBE participation requirements apply.

## Market conditions favor tightening supply

Milwaukee's multifamily fundamentals are among the strongest in the Midwest. The metro's **95.9% occupancy rate** as of Q4 2024 ranks sixth nationally among major markets. Average rents reached approximately $1,400/month in 2024, with growth projected at 2.9-3.2% through 2025—consistently above national averages.

The construction pipeline is contracting sharply. **Apartment completions are falling from 3,066 units in 2024 to approximately 1,566 units in 2025**—a 50% decline. Developers broke ground on only 1,500 new units in 2024, signaling further supply constraints in 2026-2027. This creates a "renovation over new construction" dynamic as owners improve existing properties rather than build new.

Key market indicators favor renovation work:
- Construction costs have risen 30%+ since 2019, making new builds difficult to pencil
- Unsubsidized downtown rents would need to exceed $3/SF to break even on new construction
- The average $414,000 per-unit construction cost translates to $3,333/month minimum rent to cover debt service
- Suburban submarkets (Eastern Waukesha County, Southern Ozaukee County) show strongest rent growth at 4%+

## Interest rates are easing but financing remains selective

The Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark rate six times since September 2024, bringing the federal funds rate to a target range of **3.5-3.75%** as of December 2025. While this represents 175 basis points of cumulative easing, construction financing conditions remain **selectively tight**.

**Impact on multifamily construction:**
- Construction loans priced over SOFR are becoming less expensive as short-term rates decline
- The 10-year Treasury yield—key reference for permanent financing—touched 4% recently but remains elevated by historical standards
- Mortgage rates have dropped to approximately 6.35% (30-year fixed), with projections for sub-6% by mid-2026
- Lenders continue requiring **strong debt service coverage ratios and developer equity positioning**
- Only well-prepared projects with secured tenants or demonstrated demand are moving forward

The Fed's December 2025 statement indicated economic activity expanding at a "moderate pace" with inflation "somewhat elevated." The central bank does not project meeting its 2% inflation target until 2028, suggesting continued gradual easing rather than rapid rate cuts.

**Financing implications for subcontractors:**
- Projects that paused during 2023-2024 rate spike are re-engaging with construction teams
- Developers are preparing for "smoother access to construction financing in early 2026"
- Multiple rate cuts—not just one or two—are needed to fully unlock pent-up capital
- WHEDA-financed affordable housing projects are proceeding with stronger fundamentals than market-rate

This project illustrates current market risks—even projects with innovative financing ($133 million secured) face challenges in the current cost environment.

## WHEDA affordable housing creates DBE/SBE opportunities

The **Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (WHEDA)** administers federal and state housing tax credits that finance the majority of affordable housing in Wisconsin. In 2025, WHEDA awarded **$36.6 million** in credits supporting 27 developments with 1,731 affordable units across 13 counties.

**Why WHEDA projects matter for DBE/SBE painting contractors:**

Projects receiving WHEDA financing through HUD or federal tax credits typically include **SBE, MBE, WBE, DBE, RPP, and Section 3** hiring requirements. Catalyst Construction's track record demonstrates achievable goals:
- 73% RPP hiring achieved vs. 40% requirement
- 41% SBE hiring achieved vs. 25% requirement
- THIRTEEN31 Place Apartments (Milwaukee): Projecting 31% SBE on 25% mandate, 31% Section 3 on 10% mandate

**2025-2026 QAP (Qualified Allocation Plan) highlights:**
- $42 million annual state housing tax credit cap (proposed increase to $100 million in Governor's budget)
- Bipartisan legislation passed $525 million investment in affordable housing
- Infrastructure Access loans, Restore Main Street loans, and Vacancy-to-Vitality loans all support affordable development
- 35% of annual credits may be directed to rural areas under proposed legislation

**Active Milwaukee WHEDA-financed projects:**
- **Five Points Lofts** (KG Development)
- **Riverwest Workforce Apartments & Food Accelerator** (KG Development)
- **Northwood Apartments renovation**: 72-unit, $14.5 million project at 2520 N. Martin Luther King Jr. Dr.
- Various Harambee, Concordia, Carver Park, Westlawn, and Westown neighborhood projects

**GCs active in WHEDA work:** Catalyst Construction dominates this segment with their explicit commitment to exceeding participation requirements. Greenfire Management Services also pursues affordable housing work.

## City of Milwaukee Resident Preference Program (RPP)

The **Residents Preference Program (RPP)** requires contractors on City of Milwaukee public works contracts and private developments receiving $1+ million city assistance to employ RPP-certified workers.

**Current requirements (effective January 2017):**
- **40% of total worker hours** must be attributed to RPP-certified employees
- **25% of required RPP hours** must be worked by residents in high-poverty zip codes (53204, 53205, 53206, 53208, 53210, 53212, 53215, 53218, 53233)
- **1.5x credit** for hours exceeding high-poverty zip code requirements
- Unemployment criteria: 15 days unemployed/underemployed to qualify
- Reporting through Labor Compliance Reporting app at itmdapps.milwaukee.gov

**Compliance tracking:** All contractors and subcontractors submit payroll information electronically, including employee identification, labor classification, total hours, and wage rates.

**Historical performance:** From 2010-2015, RPP workers accounted for 48% of 335,732 hours worked on contracts with RPP requirements—exceeding the 40% mandate.

**For painting subcontractors:** Understanding RPP creates competitive advantage when pursuing City-assisted projects. Contractors who can demonstrate RPP workforce access will be preferred by developers seeking to meet compliance requirements.

## TIF-assisted projects require compliance awareness

Tax Increment Financing (TIF) is the primary public subsidy mechanism for Milwaukee-area development. Projects receiving TIF assistance often trigger:
- SBE participation goals (City of Milwaukee: 25% on contracts over $25,000)
- RPP requirements (40% workforce hours)
- DBE good faith efforts on federally-connected projects

**Recent TIF approvals with affordable housing/workforce components:**
- **Mandel Group Waukesha**: $6 million TIF + $5.35 million in municipal revenue obligations
- **100 East conversion**: $14.4 million TIF for Klein Development
- **Northwood Apartments**: Up to $1.27 million TIF over 17 years

Milwaukee has expanded TIF policy to include workforce housing, adaptive reuse of commercial buildings, and downtown growth support—broadening the project types triggering compliance requirements.

## Market outlook summary

The Milwaukee multifamily market is shifting from new construction to **renovation and repositioning** due to elevated construction costs and financing constraints. This favors painting contractors in several ways:

1. **Renovation work** requires painting expertise in occupied buildings
2. **Affordable housing** funded by WHEDA creates DBE/SBE compliance pathways
3. **Supply constraints** mean landlords are investing in existing properties to command premium rents
4. **Suburban submarkets** (Waukesha, Ozaukee) show strongest activity and typically use merit-shop GCs

The combination of **DBE (WisDOT), SBE (City of Milwaukee), and lead certification** positions the client to pursue both compliance-driven affordable housing work and market-rate projects through identified GC relationships. Priority actions include:

1. Register with Greenfire Management Services as a trade partner
2. Contact NCG Hospitality regarding Moxy Milwaukee SBE/DBE opportunities
3. Monitor WHEDA award announcements for upcoming affordable housing projects
4. Build relationships with VJS Construction for Keller Real Estate Group pipeline
