## Research Question

Is flooring bundled into other trade scopes in Wisconsin multifamily construction? What are the scope packaging patterns, and who are the competitors?

---

## Executive Summary

Web research identified six distinct patterns of contractors bundling flooring with other trades in the Wisconsin/Midwest market. The strategic gap is confirmed: **no Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor currently offers painting + LVP/carpet flooring together for multifamily new construction.** Thomas A. Mason offers this combination but is union-only; IOC Construction offers it but is Chicago-based. This represents LaBrant's market entry opportunity.

The realistic "hidden" competitive threat is not roofers or finish carpenters adding flooring—it's turnkey capital-improvement vendors already embedded in GC processes. Displacement requires selling governance, compliance, and certification value rather than competing on trade price alone.

## Key Findings by Pattern

### Pattern 1: Carpentry + Flooring + Cabinets/Countertops

**QBC (Quest Building Corp)** — DeForest, WI

QBC bundles rough carpentry, finish carpentry, cabinetry, countertops, flooring, and materials supply under one contract. Founded in 1998, they operate a 7,500 SF office and 27,000 SF fabrication shop. Their project range spans $50K tenant rehabs to $115M+ multifamily developments, with service area covering Dane County, Madison, Milwaukee, Fox Valley, and Northern Illinois.

Key clients include Stevens Construction, Forward Management, McGann Construction, and 1848 Construction—all merit-shop GCs in LaBrant's target market. QBC explicitly does NOT do painting, positioning as a carpentry/flooring package with the value proposition of "one contract, one schedule, one point of accountability."

**Strategic Implication:** QBC validates the multi-scope model at significant scale with merit-shop GCs. Their explicit absence of painting creates the Division 9 gap LaBrant intends to fill. Consider QBC as either a complementary partner (LaBrant handles painting, QBC handles carpentry/cabinets/flooring) or as the model to emulate.

### Pattern 2: Multi-Division Interior Contractor (Scaled Model)

**H.J. Martin and Son** — Green Bay, WI

H.J. Martin bundles commercial flooring, walls/ceilings (drywall and acoustical), glass/glazing, doors/hardware, retail fixtures, and millwork. They operate at $150M+ annual revenue with 600+ employees and are licensed in all 50 states. As a 4th-generation family business founded in 1931, they represent the "gold standard" of multi-scope interior contracting in Wisconsin.

H.J. Martin is union-affiliated (INSTALL alliance partner) and a Starnet Commercial Flooring Cooperative member. Their target market is national retail chains including Target, Best Buy, Walmart, and Menards, along with corporate and hospitality segments.

**Strategic Implication:** H.J. Martin demonstrates the scalable end-state of multi-division positioning but operates in a different segment (national retail, union, Green Bay-based). Not a direct competitor for SE Wisconsin merit-shop multifamily.

---

### Pattern 3: Insulation + Flooring (Adjacent Trade Bundle)

**Insulation Inc. + Flooring Inc.** — Coon Rapids, MN (serves Wisconsin)

These two companies share an address and market themselves as "Partner Companies" while maintaining separate identities. Insulation Inc. handles spray foam, cellulose, blown fiberglass, and waterproofing. Flooring Inc. handles hardwood, laminate, carpet, vinyl, tile, epoxy, linoleum, and gypsum underlayment. They serve residential, multifamily, and commercial projects across Minnesota and Wisconsin.

**Strategic Implication:** The "partner company" model could inform LaBrant's approach—maintain painting identity while launching a related flooring entity under shared operations. The insulation-to-flooring adjacency (underlayment, acoustic mats) parallels the painting-to-flooring adjacency (Division 9 finishes).

---

### Pattern 4: Painting + Epoxy Flooring (Industrial Focus)

Several Milwaukee-area painting contractors have expanded into epoxy/polyurea floor coatings:

**K2 Painting** (Milwaukee) offers commercial/industrial painting plus epoxy floor coatings, operating as a merit shop with a 5-year guarantee. They target commercial, industrial, retail, basements, and garages.

**Lakeside Painting, Inc.** (Milwaukee) bundles industrial/commercial painting with epoxy flooring, focusing on manufacturing plants, commercial garages, and warehouses.

**CertaPro Painters of Milwaukee** operates as a franchise offering residential/commercial painting plus epoxy/polyurea floors, targeting light commercial applications in food manufacturing, medical, and retail.

**Strategic Implication:** These contractors validate painting-to-flooring expansion in the Milwaukee market but focus on industrial/commercial epoxy coatings rather than apartment LVP/carpet. Different product segment than LaBrant's target market—confirms the multifamily LVP gap remains unserved.

---

### Pattern 5: Painting + Flooring (Union Model)

**Thomas A. Mason Company** — Milwaukee, WI

Thomas A. Mason is the only Wisconsin contractor currently packaging painting and flooring together. Founded in 1912, they operate at $12M–$21M revenue with 80+ union workers under IUPAT (International Union of Painters and Allied Trades) and Carpenters unions.

Their flooring services include ceramic/quarry tile, resilient flooring (LVP, linoleum), carpet, pre-finished engineered wood, and vinyl wall covering. They hold DBE, MBE, SBE, HUB, WHEDA, and Lead Abatement certifications, giving them advantages on public and institutional work. Notable projects include Milwaukee City Hall ($60M restoration), Northwestern Mutual Towers/Commons, and General Mitchell International Airport.

**Critical Limitation:** Thomas A. Mason is union-only, which limits their competitiveness on private merit-shop multifamily projects. Their focus appears to be institutional and municipal work where union requirements are common.

**Strategic Implication:** Thomas A. Mason proves the combined painting + flooring model works at scale (112 years, $21M revenue). However, their union structure creates an opening for a non-union competitor in private multifamily.

---

### Pattern 6: Turnkey Property Renovation Contractors

**IOC Construction** — Batavia, IL (serves Milwaukee market)

IOC bundles roofing, painting, flooring, siding, and construction services. They operate at $9.5M–$50M revenue with 51–200 employees and have been in business approximately 35 years. Key contacts are David Lockhart and Tim Ross.

Their target market includes property managers, multifamily, condo/HOA, and commercial high-rise. As a merit-shop contractor, they represent the closest direct competitor to LaBrant's intended positioning.

**Disadvantage:** IOC is Chicago-based (90 miles from Milwaukee), creating response-time and relationship disadvantages versus a Milwaukee-based competitor. They also lack DBE/SBE certifications that LaBrant holds.

**Renu Inc.** (National)

Renu operates as a turnkey renovation general contractor for multifamily housing, offering cabinets, painting, flooring, fixtures, and capex work under one umbrella. They serve apartment complexes, senior housing, student housing, and hospitality. While not Wisconsin-based, they represent the competitive model that could expand into the market.

**Strategic Implication:** These turnkey capital-improvement vendors compete on convenience and embedded GC relationships rather than trade expertise or certification leverage. The risk is a GC already having a "program vendor" for flooring.

## Scope Bundling Research Findings

**Is flooring bundled into finish carpentry?**

No, not as a standard practice. Finish carpentry standards (per AWI—Architectural Woodwork Institute) focus on architectural woodwork installation (trim, millwork, related interior products), not resilient/carpet flooring installs. Real-world finish carpentry scopes frequently reference coordination with "finish floor" (holding doors off the finish floor, trimming later), which signals flooring is adjacent/sequence-dependent, not included.

QBC bundles flooring AS A SEPARATE SCOPE under one contract alongside carpentry—they're not claiming flooring IS carpentry. Per AWI standards and Division 9 spec practice, flooring remains its own defined scope.

**Are roofers bundling flooring?**

In multifamily new construction, no. Roofing + flooring bundling exists in two contexts that are not relevant to LaBrant's target segment:

1. Industrial/corporate divisions (CentiMark/QuestMark model) — industrial coatings and polished concrete, not apartment LVP/carpet
2. Residential remodelers scaling to light commercial — not typical multifamily new-construction trade overlap

IOC Construction bundles roofing + painting + flooring, but they evolved from a painting contractor to a full-service property management renovation company rather than from roofing into flooring.

**Division 9 classification**

Both painting and flooring fall under CSI Division 9 (Finishes):
- Flooring: Section 09 60 00 (general), 09 65 00 (resilient), 09 68 00 (carpet)
- Painting: Section 09 90 00

This shared division makes scope expansion logical for bidding and GC relationships.

## Strategic Gap Confirmed

**No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor offers painting + LVP/carpet flooring together for multifamily new construction.**

| Competitor | Why Not Direct Competition |
|------------|---------------------------|
| QBC | Carpentry + flooring, NO painting |
| Suburban Drywall | Drywall + painting, NO flooring |
| Thomas A. Mason | Painting + flooring, UNION ONLY |
| IOC Construction | Painting + flooring, CHICAGO BASED (90 miles) |
| K2/Lakeside | Painting + epoxy only (not apartment LVP/carpet) |

This gap represents LaBrant's market entry opportunity.

## Risk Assessment: Turnkey Interiors Vendors

The realistic "hidden" competitor isn't a roofer or finish carpenter—it's a **turnkey remodeler / capital-improvement contractor** already embedded in a GC's process. These vendors sell multiple scopes (roofing, exterior, interior, flooring, paint) under one banner and sub out pieces.

They compete on "one contract" convenience—not on trade expertise or certification leverage. The risk is that a GC defaults to their existing program vendor for flooring because the relationship is already established, even if LaBrant's pricing is competitive.

**Counter-Move:** On pilot GC conversations, ask directly:

> "Do you already use a turnkey capital-improvement or bundled interiors vendor for flooring? If yes, where are they failing you—schedule reliability, warranty claims, documentation, or participation goal tracking?"

This reveals whether you're competing against a **trade sub** (winnable on price/quality) or a **program vendor** (requires selling governance + compliance value to displace).

---

## GC Interview Validation Questions

Add these to MSP and other GC conversations:

1. "When you award painting and flooring on multifamily, do you prefer: (a) separate specialized subs for each trade, (b) one sub handling both under a single contract, or (c) flexible depending on project? What would it take for you to try option (b) if you haven't before?"

2. "Do you already have a bundled interiors vendor you default to for flooring? Where are they underperforming?"

3. "Would DBE/SBE certification on combined painting + flooring scope help you meet participation requirements more easily?"

---

## Competitive Positioning Recommendations

1. **Lead with certification leverage** where applicable—DBE/SBE status differentiates versus IOC and other out-of-state competitors without diversity certifications

2. **Emphasize Division 9 consolidation**—single sub for painting + flooring reduces GC coordination burden and simplifies punch list accountability

3. **Target merit-shop multifamily**—Thomas A. Mason's union structure limits their competitiveness in this specific segment

4. **Position as local Milwaukee alternative** to Chicago-based IOC—faster response, existing local relationships, proven track record with area GCs

5. **Monitor QBC** as potential partner or competitor—if they add painting, the gap closes; consider proactive partnership conversation

6. **Document substrate responsibility clearly**—flooring has higher liability exposure than painting around moisture and substrate prep; contractual clarity is essential
