## Lead Certification Requirements

### Regulatory Framework

**EPA RRP Rule + Wisconsin DHS:**
- Applies to pre-1978 buildings
- Schools are "child-occupied facilities" (stricter requirements)
- Certified renovator must be on-site
- Lead-safe work practices mandatory
- Documentation and recordkeeping required

### School Building Age Analysis

| Era | % of Schools | Lead Risk | Certification Need |
|-----|--------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Pre-1950 | ~30% | HIGH | **REQUIRED** |
| 1950-1978 | ~40% | MODERATE | **REQUIRED** |
| Post-1978 | ~30% | LOW | Not required |

**Result:** ~70% of private school buildings require lead-certified contractors

### Marketing Lead Certification

**To School Administrators:**

> "Federal EPA regulations require certified contractors for any renovation work in schools built before 1978. As a Wisconsin DHS certified lead renovator, we ensure your project complies with all regulations while protecting students and staff from lead exposure.
>
> Our lead-safe work practices include proper containment, specialized cleaning, and documentation--giving you peace of mind and regulatory compliance."
