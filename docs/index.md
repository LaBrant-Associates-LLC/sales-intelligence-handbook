## Purpose

We currently derive most revenue from less than 10 GC relationships. This research identified 35+ merit-shop GCs, multiple private and institutional markets, and $4M-$8M of incremental opportunity aligned with our certifications and operating model.

**Goal:** Diversify work portfolio across other markets while expanding multifamily bidding.
