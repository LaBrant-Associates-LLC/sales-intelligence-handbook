# Part 7: Wisconsin Multifamily Operators & Development Pipeline | SE Wisconsin Focus
**Date:** 12/25/25 | **Revision:** 1
**Changelog:** Rev 1 - Expanded from Rev 0 with extensive development pipeline research, hotel projects, religious institution renovations, retail developments (Scheels/Mayfair), merit-shop GC intelligence (Stevens, VJS, Greenfire), and additional operator contacts

---

## Executive Summary

Wisconsin's multifamily market operates through **regional relationships rather than national vendor procurement systems**. Key finding: Most major national REITs (AvalonBay, Equity Residential, MAA, UDR, Camden, Essex) have **NO Wisconsin presence**--they focus on coastal and Sun Belt markets. This creates opportunity for local certification advantages.

**2025 Milwaukee Market Outlook:**
- Occupancy rate: 95.9% (6th nationally among major markets)
- Average rent: ~$1,439/month projected Q4 2025
- New construction declining 40% vs 2024 (lowest since 2015)
- Rent growth: 2.9-3.2% projected 2025
- Strongest submarkets: Outlying Waukesha County (+4.1%), Southern Ozaukee County (+4.0%)

## KEY STRATEGIC FINDINGS

2. **AOMA membership provides direct access** to operators controlling 50,000+ units through single networking investment.

3. **Merit-shop GCs dominate the opportunity set:** Stevens, Greenfire, VJS have active pipelines in target markets.

4. **100 East Tower ($165M conversion)** represents a major near-term opportunity--Stevens Construction confirmed as co-GC.

5. **Capri Communities' vertically integrated model** (Tarantino & Company development arm) creates ongoing pipeline across 43 properties.

6. **Historic conversions favor DHS lead certification**--J. Jeffers, Klein Development, 100 East all involve pre-1978 buildings.

7. **Senior living market strength:** Capri, VJS, Greenfire all have active senior living portfolios--aligns perfectly with LaBrant target markets.
