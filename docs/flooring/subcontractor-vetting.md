## Part 1: BYCO Tile and Floor — Primary Subcontractor Candidate

### Company Profile

|-----------|---------|---------------------|
| Legal Name | BYCO, Inc. (dba BYCO Tile and Floor) |  Verified |
| Headquarters | 787 4th St, Mayville, WI 53050 | Verified (Blue Book, D&B) |
| Mailing | P.O. Box 148, Mayville, WI 53050 | Verified |

| Blue Book Listed | Since 2001 | Verified |
| Employee Count | **1-4 employees** | Blue Book/D&B — CRITICAL CAPACITY CONCERN |
| Union Status | Non-union | Confirmed |

### Certification Claims vs. Verification

BYCO claims MBE, SBE, and DBE WI certifications on their website. However, certification verification requires direct database searches:

**Verification Steps Required:**

1. **WisDOT DBE Directory** — Search wisconsindot.gov/pages/doing-bus/civil-rights/dbe/certified-firms.aspx for "BYCO"
2. **Wisconsin Supplier Diversity Program** — Search wisdp.wi.gov/Search.aspx for "BYCO Inc"
3. **Milwaukee County B2GNow** — Search county.milwaukee.gov for TBE/DBE status
4. **City of Milwaukee SBE** — Verify SBE certification through city procurement office

**Note:** The DBE program is currently undergoing federal recertification updates. WisDOT announced: "Although no DBE goals will be assigned until the DBE recertification process is complete..." This may affect BYCO's certification status.

### Service Capabilities

**Full-Service Commercial Flooring:**
- Ceramic tile installation
- Carpet and carpet tile
- Resilient flooring (LVP, LVT, sheet vinyl, linoleum)
- Industrial flooring
- Floor demolition and removal
- Substrate testing (RH, calcium chloride, pH testing)
- Factory floor maintenance

**Service Territory:** Appleton, Beaver Dam, Columbus, Fond Du Lac, Madison, Menomonee Falls, Milwaukee, Monroe, Muskego, Oconomowoc, Oshkosh, Watertown, Waukesha, Waupun, West Bend

**Operational Capabilities:**
- Occupied office remodeling
- Furniture and cubical moving
- 2nd, 3rd shift and weekend availability
- Mechanical floor removal equipment

### Market Positioning

BYCO positions itself as a value-oriented commercial flooring contractor emphasizing "low overhead and high efficiency." Their website states: "Competitive pricing through low overhead and high efficiency." This suggests they may price competitively but have limited capacity for large projects.

### Reviews and Reputation

**Yelp (5 reviews as of October 2019):**
Positive review mentions "Andres" as key contact — "very knowledgeable and accessible." Work described: bathroom shower tile (penny tiles, subway tiles), fireplace stackstone. Note: These are residential-scale projects, not commercial multifamily.

**Blue Book/ProView:** Listed since 2001 in Floor Treatments/Coatings/Preservatives, Resilient Floor Contractors, M.W.B.E.--Floors & Flooring, Tile Contractors.

**Procore:** Listed as serving Mayville, WI area, specializing in Flooring, Tile.

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Assessment | Mitigation |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Capacity** | HIGH RISK — 1-4 employees cannot handle large multifamily projects alone | Request crew size confirmation; may need multiple subs |
| **Financial** | UNKNOWN — No revenue data available | Request financials, bonding capacity, references |
| **Certification** | NEEDS VERIFICATION — Claims MBE/SBE/DBE but not independently verified | Search state databases before relying on certification |
| **Insurance** | UNKNOWN — No COI on file | Request certificates before any agreement |
| **Experience** | MODERATE — 72 years in business suggests stability | Request specific multifamily project references |
| **Location** | LOW RISK — Mayville is 55 miles from Milwaukee | Verify they regularly work in Milwaukee metro |

### Recommended Vetting Actions

**Before First Meeting:**
1. Search Wisconsin Supplier Diversity Program database for BYCO Inc
2. Search WisDOT DBE directory for BYCO Inc
3. Check Dodge County and Milwaukee County court records for any liens or judgments

**At First Meeting (Call 262-894-6995):**
1. Request Certificate of Insurance (GL, WC, Auto)
2. Ask about crew size and capacity for 100+ unit projects
3. Request 3 recent commercial project references (preferably multifamily)
4. Discuss typical pricing structure (per SF, per unit, etc.)
5. Ask about bonding capacity
6. Verify current certification status and expiration dates
7. Discuss payment terms and retainage expectations

## Part 2: Alternative Subcontractor Candidates

Given BYCO's capacity concerns (1-4 employees), identifying backup subcontractors is essential.

### Option A: FLOOR360 (Madison/Milwaukee)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | Madison HQ, Milwaukee office at 12500 W Silver Spring Dr |
| Phone | 608-274-2500 (Madison) |
| Revenue | $12.5-15 million |
| Employees | 56-69 |
| Union Status | Non-union |
| Certifications | **None identified** |

**Pros:** Large, established, in-house crews, proven commercial capability, active in multifamily
**Cons:** No certifications (no diversity stacking value), Madison-headquartered, could be competitor rather than partner

**Key Contacts:**
- Matt Nelson: mnelson@floor360.com (Milwaukee)
- Bob Blake: bblake@floor360.com (Milwaukee)

**Strategic Consideration:** FLOOR360 could be approached as a subcontractor partner for carpet/tile while LaBrant self-performs LVP, OR they could be a flooring-only competitor. Worth exploring relationship before they become aware of LaBrant's flooring expansion plans.

### Option B: Commercial Flooring Inc (South Milwaukee)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | South Milwaukee, WI |
| Procore Profile | Listed as Specialty Contractor |
| Specialties | Flooring, Cleaning and Maintenance |

**Status:** Requires additional research. Listed on Procore serving South Milwaukee area.

### Option C: Maly Ceramic Tile Company (Sun Prairie)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | Sun Prairie, WI |
| Founded | 1960 |
| Specialties | Tile, stone, quarry, LVP, vinyl, rubber, carpet, engineered wood |
| Market | Commercial and residential |

**Pros:** Family-owned, 64+ years in business, full-service flooring
**Cons:** Sun Prairie location (80+ miles from Milwaukee), unknown capacity

### Option D: Bubblegum Flooring (Milwaukee)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Location | Southeast Wisconsin |
| Service Area | Milwaukee County, Waukesha County, Racine County |
| Specialties | Commercial flooring installation, replacement, repair |

**Note:** Newer company, appears to be residential-focused but lists commercial capabilities. Would need vetting for commercial multifamily experience.

### Subcontractor Comparison Matrix

| Criteria | BYCO | FLOOR360 | Maly Ceramic | Bubblegum |
|----------|------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Milwaukee Proximity | 55 mi | Office in MKE | 80+ mi | In MKE |
| Certifications | MBE/SBE/DBE (claimed) | None | Unknown | Unknown |
| Capacity | Very Small (1-4) | Large (56-69) | Unknown | Unknown |
| Multifamily Experience | Unknown | Confirmed | Unknown | Unknown |
| Union Status | Non-union | Non-union | Unknown | Non-union |
| Partnership Potential | High | Moderate | Moderate | Low |

**Recommendation:** Pursue BYCO for certification stacking value but develop FLOOR360 relationship as capacity backup. BYCO's small size means they likely cannot handle sole-source flooring on large multifamily projects.
