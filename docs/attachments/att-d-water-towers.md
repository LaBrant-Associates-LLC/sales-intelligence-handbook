## Tower Types & Painting Considerations

### Composite Elevated Tanks (CET)
- **Structure:** Concrete pedestal + steel tank
- **Painting Scope:** Tank only (concrete unpainted)
- **Advantage:** Lower maintenance costs
- **Capacity Range:** 500,000 - 3,000,000 gallons
- **Examples:** Waukesha Composite Tower (1M gal)

### Traditional Elevated (Full Steel)
- **Structure:** Steel legs/pedestal + steel tank
- **Painting Scope:** Complete structure
- **Higher Maintenance:** Full steel requires more coating area
- **Examples:** Waukesha Hunter Tower (400K gal)

### Standpipe
- **Structure:** Tall cylinder, no elevation
- **Typical Size:** Low capacity relative to height
- **Example:** 72' height × 47' diameter = 1M gal

### Spheroid
- **Structure:** Spherical/elliptical tank on pedestal
- **Typical Capacity:** 200,000 - 500,000 gallons
