## Certification Leverage by Project Type

### Milwaukee City Projects

- **Goal:** 25% SBE participation
- **Preference:** 10% bid preference
- **Leverage:** LaBrant's SBE status applies to both painting AND flooring scope
- **Value:** Combined scope means larger dollar credit toward 25% goal

### Milwaukee County Projects

- **Goal:** 25% TBE participation
- **Recognition:** DBE = TBE reciprocity
- **Leverage:** Same stacking benefit as City projects

### WHEDA-Funded Projects

- **Requirement:** Diversity participation on all HTC awards
- **Value:** Combined scope simplifies GC compliance documentation
- **Benefit:** Single subcontractor agreement, single certified payroll, single diversity report

### RPP (Resident Preference Program)

- **Requirement:** Milwaukee resident workforce hours
- **Leverage:** If LaBrant hires Milwaukee residents for both trades, workforce hours count toward RPP requirements
- **Value:** Combined scope = more opportunities to deploy RPP-qualified workers

### Certification Coverage from WHEDA 2025 Data

| Certification | Units with Advantage |
|---------------|---------------------|
| DBE advantage | 1,012 units |
