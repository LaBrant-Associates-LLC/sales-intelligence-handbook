### ✅ TIER 2: Growth Targets (Maintain/Improve)
Good margins (20-35%) with room for improvement:

| GC/Client | Revenue | Net Margin | Jobs | Action |
|-----------|---------|------------|------|--------|
| Nicholas & Associates | $1,581,472 | 34.1% | 2 | Near Tier 1 threshold |
| Cardinal Capital | $1,502,929 | 34.5% | 6 | Consistent performer |

| Consolidated Construction | $383,775 | 34.2% | 7 | High volume opportunity |
| Market & Johnson | $329,110 | 26.1% | 1 | Acceptable |

### ⚠️ TIER 3: Review Pricing (Thin Margins)
Positive margins but below target (<20%):

| GC/Client | Revenue | Net Margin | Jobs | Issue |
|-----------|---------|------------|------|-------|
| KCG | $468,186 | 17.1% | 1 | Single job, thin margin |
| Horizon (HCG) | $687,375 | 16.3% | 2 | Large volume, pricing issue |
| Peridot CM | $244,307 | 10.3% | 9 | Many small jobs, low margin |
| TAE & Associates | $441,655 | 5.4% | 2 | Barely profitable |

**Recommendation:** Schedule pricing discussions before next bids. Target minimum 25% net margin.

### 🔴 TIER 4: Avoid/Exit (Loss Relationships)
Unprofitable relationships to discontinue or restructure:

| GC/Client | Revenue | Net Loss | Issue |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| LB West Construction | $469,940 | $(62,620) | Out-of-state AZ job |
| CG Schmidt | $95,360 | $(57,516) | Public school work |
| CL1 Properties (Hyatt) | $141,778 | $(46,538) | Multiple Hyatt losses |
| Corliss | $145,777 | $(243,267) | Major data/scope issue |

---

## Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Data Quality Issues (Priority: HIGH)
| Entry | Amount | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **SPLIT** | $(698,310) loss | Cost allocation entry showing $870K COGS against $172K revenue. Not a real job - needs QB cleanup. |
| **Corliss** | $(243,267) loss | $146K revenue with $370K COGS. Investigate billing vs. cost mismatch. |
| **Stevens Construction** | $(115,224) loss | Shows $0 revenue - unbilled work or data entry error |

**Total questionable losses:** ~$1,057,000 (51% of reported losses)  
**Adjusted Net Income (excluding data issues):** ~$5,219,000 (32% net margin)

### 2. Out-of-State Projects Losing Money
Both Arizona projects are losses:
- **190714 - Libertad (AZ):** $508,873 revenue, $(44,153) loss
- **200304 - Vista Winds (AZ):** $469,940 revenue, $(62,620) loss

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue out-of-state work. Travel, coordination, and unfamiliarity with local conditions destroy margins.

### 3. High Subcontractor Dependency
| Labor Component | Amount | % of Labor | % of Revenue |
|-----------------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Subcontractors | $6,230,475 | **69.8%** | 38.2% |
| Internal Painters | $2,508,595 | 28.1% | 15.4% |
| Other Labor | $185,082 | 2.1% | 1.1% |

**Risk:** Nearly 70% of labor is subcontracted, limiting margin control.

**Opportunity:** Each 10% shift from subcontractors to internal painters could add ~$150,000-$200,000 to profit (assuming 25% margin capture on sub premium).

## Job Size Sweet Spot Analysis

| Job Size | Count | Revenue | Avg Margin | Profit/Job |
|----------|-------|---------|------------|------------|
| Under $50K | 40 | $752K | 26.8% | $2,860 |
| **$50K-$100K** | 15 | $1.08M | **53.0%** | **$37,697** |
| $100K-$250K | 25 | $3.84M | 18.2% | $25,039 |
| $250K-$500K | 11 | $4.25M | 25.9% | $90,913 |
| **$500K+** | 7 | $6.38M | **34.6%** | **$346,958** |

**Key Insight:** Mid-size jobs ($50K-$100K) have the highest margin percentage, but large jobs ($500K+) generate the most profit per project. 

**Sweet Spots:**
1. **$50K-$100K jobs** - Highest margin efficiency (53%), good for crew utilization
2. **$500K+ jobs** - Best absolute profit ($347K average), economies of scale

**Avoid:** Jobs in the $100K-$250K range showing weak 18.2% average margin - investigate why.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Clean up QuickBooks data** - Investigate SPLIT, Corliss, and Stevens entries
2. **Review Hyatt jobs** - CL1 Properties relationship is unprofitable
3. **Pull back from AZ work** - Confirm no pending out-of-state bids

### Q1 2026 Priorities
1. **Deepen Tier 1 relationships:**
   - Schedule lunch with McShane project managers
   - Request meeting with Fiduciary to discuss 2026 pipeline
   - Ask Greenfire about upcoming senior living projects

2. **Address pricing on Tier 3 accounts:**
   - Peridot CM: 9 jobs at 10% margin is not sustainable
   - Horizon: Large volume but need 25%+ to make sense
   - TAE: 5.4% margin - likely estimating errors

3. **Evaluate subcontractor mix:**
   - Identify top 5 subcontractors by spend
   - Analyze which work could be brought in-house
   - Target 50% internal labor (from current 30%)

### Strategic Goals
| Metric | Current | Target | Impact |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Net Margin | 25.5% | 30% | +$730K annually |
| Internal Labor Ratio | 28% | 40% | +$150K margin capture |
| Loss Jobs | 17 | <5 | +$500K (data cleanup alone) |
| Avg Job Size | $166K | $200K | Better overhead absorption |
