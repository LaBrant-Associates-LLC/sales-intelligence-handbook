## Executive Summary: P&L-Driven Strategic Priorities

Based on analysis of 126 jobs totaling $16.3M revenue with 25.5% net margin ($4.16M net income), this report identifies the highest-value GC and developer relationships for systematic expansion.

**Key Finding:** Your top 6 GC relationships generated $9.6M revenue (59% of total) at 40%+ weighted average margins. Strategic deepening of these relationships represents the highest-ROI business development path.

## TIER 1: STRATEGIC PARTNERS (Proven High-Value Relationships)

### 1. WINGSPAN DEVELOPMENT GROUP / NICHOLAS & ASSOCIATES
**Your Performance:** $1.58M revenue | 34% net margin | $539K net profit
- HUB13 (Oak Creek): $779K revenue, $348K profit (44.7% margin)
- The Ruby: $802K revenue, $191K profit (23.8% margin)

**Strategic Importance:** Nicholas & Associates is the construction arm of Wingspan Development Group. Your Pabst Farms job ($2M revenue, $840K profit at McShane) was likely a Wingspan development. This relationship potentially represents **$1.38M+ in combined profit** from one development ecosystem.

**ACTIVE WISCONSIN PIPELINE:**
| Project | Location | Units | Est. Painting Value | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| Pabst 59 Innovation Hub | Oconomowoc | 320,000 SF office + retail + MF | $500K-$1M+ | Under development |

- Seasons @ Franklin: $944K revenue, $570K profit (60.4% margin)

**Strategic Importance:** FRED is Wisconsin's largest market-rate multifamily owner (9,500+ units). They act as their **own general contractor** - meaning LaBrant works directly with FRED, no GC intermediary. This direct relationship explains the exceptional margins.

**ACTIVE WISCONSIN PIPELINE:**
| Project | Location | Units | Est. Painting Value | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| West Bend Development | 2010-2012 S. River Road | 391 units (17 buildings) | $500K-$800K | Approved Oct 2025 |

**Leadership Transition Alert:** With Miller retiring and Bersell taking over, now is optimal time to solidify relationship before organizational changes.

**Action:** Schedule meeting with operations team. Reference Seasons @ Franklin/Mt. Pleasant success. Position for West Bend 391-unit project (largest in their 2025 pipeline).

---

### 3. McSHANE CONSTRUCTION
**Your Performance:** $2.0M revenue | 42% net margin | $837K net profit
- Pabst Farms: $2.0M revenue, $840K profit (41.9% margin)

**Strategic Importance:** Your single largest profitable job came through McShane. They have a dominant relationship with Lincoln Avenue Communities (LAC), the #1 affordable housing developer in the US. LAC is building **500+ units** currently in Wisconsin with McShane as exclusive GC.

**ACTIVE WISCONSIN PIPELINE (McShane/LAC):**
| Project | Location | Units | Est. Painting Value | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| The Flats at Bishop's Woods | Brookfield | 203 units | $300K-$450K | Dec 2025 completion |
| The Conway at Huxley Yards | Madison | 50 units | $75K-$125K | Q3 2026 completion |

### 4. GREENFIRE MANAGEMENT SERVICES
**Your Performance:** $1.43M revenue | 37% net margin | $535K net profit
- Zuelke Building: $398K revenue, $175K profit (43.9% margin)
- 37th St School: $351K revenue, $170K profit (48.3% margin)
- The Merge Ashwaubenon: $267K revenue, $137K profit (51.4% margin)
- Phillis Wheatly School: $378K revenue, $20K profit (5.4% margin)

**Strategic Importance:** Greenfire is **100% minority-owned** (Forest County Potawatomi) and **NEVER self-performs** - all trade work goes to subcontractors. They actively seek DBE/MBE relationships to stack diversity credits. Combined Greenfire MBE + LaBrant DBE = powerful certification combination.

**ACTIVE PIPELINE:**
| Project | Developer | Units | Est. Painting Value | Status |
|---------|-----------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| Cornerstone Village | Cardinal Capital | 71 units (55+) | $100K-$175K | Active 2025 |
| Wgema Campus | Potawatomi | Historic | Varies | Ongoing |
| Potawatomi Casino expansion | Potawatomi | Hospitality | Varies | Multi-phase |

**Key Contacts:**
- Milwaukee Office: 414-290-9400
- Wausau Office: 715-863-2510

**Action:** High-priority relationship maintenance. Reference successful margin history. Greenfire's "never self-perform" model is perfect for LaBrant.

---

### 5. CARDINAL CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
**Your Performance:** $1.50M revenue | 35% net margin | $519K net profit
- Middleton Market: $569K revenue, $267K profit (47.0% margin)
- Clifford & Regina Apts: $237K revenue, $114K profit (48.0% margin)
- Clarke Square Apts: $113K revenue, $58K profit (51.1% margin)
- Cardinal Capital Other: $72K revenue, $121K profit (169% - likely T&M/extras)

**Note:** One loss job - Libertad (AZ): $509K revenue, -$44K loss. Arizona projects may have different dynamics.

**Strategic Importance:** Cardinal Capital is a Milwaukee-based affordable housing developer with strong WHEDA relationships. Their active projects use Greenfire as CM.

**Current Project:** Cornerstone Village (71 units, 55+ housing) with Greenfire - potential painting scope.

---

## AVOID LIST (Based on P&L Analysis)

### GCs with Significant Losses:

| GC/Entity | Jobs | Revenue | Net Income | Net % | Notes |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|-------|-------|
| **SPLIT** | 1 | $172K | **-$698K** | -406% | Catastrophic loss - investigate |
| **Corliss** | 2 | $146K | **-$243K** | -167% | Two losing jobs |
| **CG Schmidt** | 1 | $95K | **-$58K** | -60% | Union-signatory, Horlick project |
| **LB West Construction** | 1 | $470K | **-$63K** | -13% | Arizona project (Vista Winds) |
| **CL1 Properties** | 2 | $142K | **-$47K** | -33% | Hyatt projects |
| **Peridot CM** | 9 | $244K | **$25K** | **10%** | High volume, low margin |

**Critical Findings:**
1. **SPLIT entity** requires immediate investigation - $698K loss on $172K revenue suggests catastrophic cost overrun or accounting issue
2. **Arizona projects** (Libertad via Cardinal, Vista Winds via LB West) both lost money - out-of-state work may have different risk profile
3. **Peridot CM** - 9 jobs but only 10% margin indicates pricing or scope issues
4. **CG Schmidt** - Union-signatory GC, aligns with "avoid" guidance

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Week of December 30, 2025)

### Priority 1: Protect & Deepen Established Relationships
- [ ] **Greenfire** (414-290-9400): Schedule Q1 2026 planning call, inquire about Cornerstone Village status
- [ ] **FRED/Fiduciary** (414-226-4535): Request meeting with Steve Bersell (incoming President). Reference Seasons success, position for West Bend 391-unit project
- [ ] **Nicholas/Wingspan**: Contact Jason Piurkowski re: Pabst 59 timeline

### Priority 2: Recover/Maintain Strong Relationships
- [ ] **MSP**: Investigate Yellowstone Market Rate loss ($82K). Proactive outreach to prevent relationship damage
- [ ] **Cardinal Capital**: Confirm Cornerstone Village painting scope through Greenfire

### Priority 3: New Market Development
- [ ] **Moore Construction** (262-345-1280): Introduction call, reference merit-shop alignment
- [ ] **Stevens Construction**: Complete prequalification package submission to Jodi Huntoon
- [ ] **McShane/Alison Gorham**: Request introduction, emphasize DBE certification for WHEDA projects

### Priority 4: Investigate Losses
- [ ] **SPLIT entity**: Identify what this is and why -$698K loss occurred
- [ ] **Arizona projects**: Determine if out-of-state work should be avoided going forward
- [ ] **Peridot CM**: Analyze why 9 jobs yielded only 10% margin

---

## DEEP DIVE: PROBLEM JOB ANALYSIS

### SPLIT Entity (-$698K Loss)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $172,027 |
| COGS | $870,165 |
| Loss | **-$698,310** |

**Analysis:** COGS is 5x revenue. This is likely a cost allocation bucket or umbrella job where costs were charged but revenue wasn't properly allocated. Requires accounting review to identify:
- What projects are these costs actually associated with?
- Is this a "catch-all" job code for unbilled work?
- Are these warranty/rework costs from other projects?

**Recommendation:** Immediate QuickBooks review to trace COGS line items.

---

### Peridot CM (9 Jobs, 10% Blended Margin)
**Detailed Job Analysis:**
| Job | Revenue | COGS | Net Income | Net % | Status |
|-----|---------|------|------------|-------|--------|
| AMP Elkhorn | $85,140 | $22,953 | $62,187 | **73%** | ✅ Excellent |
| Hyatt Lobby | $46,519 | $16,266 | $30,195 | **65%** | ✅ Excellent |
| Peridot Other | $9,249 | $0 | $9,249 | **100%** | ✅ |
| Mantel Ortho | $11,694 | $7,852 | $3,842 | **33%** | ✅ OK |
| Panera Bread GB | $4,308 | $2,182 | $2,126 | **49%** | ✅ OK |
| Julien Shade | $1,910 | $1,400 | $510 | **27%** | ⚠️ Low |
| **Hyatt Regency Ballrooms** | $62,096 | $102,267 | **-$40,171** | **-65%** | ❌ LOSS |
| **2515 Wauwatosa** | $23,391 | $56,459 | **-$40,505** | **-173%** | ❌ LOSS |

**Analysis:** 
- 6 of 9 jobs were profitable (avg 58% margin on profitable work)
- 2 jobs lost $80,676 combined, wiping out most gains
- Both loss jobs had COGS 1.6-2.4x revenue = severe underpricing or scope creep
- Hyatt Ballrooms and 2515 Wauwatosa should be reviewed for lessons learned

**Root Cause Investigation:**
1. Were these lump-sum bids that experienced scope changes?
2. Did labor productivity fall below estimates?
3. Were there material cost overruns?
4. Was there adequate change order management?

**Recommendation:** Peridot is not inherently a bad client - profitable work exists. Implement stricter scope management and change order discipline on future Peridot projects.

### Arizona Projects (-$107K Combined Loss)
| Job | GC | Revenue | COGS | Expenses | Net Loss |
|-----|-----|---------|------|----------|----------|
| Libertad (AZ) | Cardinal Capital | $508,873 | $520,212 | $32,814 | **-$44,153** |
| Vista Winds (AZ) | LB West | $469,940 | $414,902 | $40,384 | **-$62,620** |
| **Total** | | **$978,813** | **$935,114** | **$73,198** | **-$106,773** |

**Analysis:**
- Combined: ~$1M revenue, -$107K loss (-11% margin)
- Both jobs had high expense ratios ($73K combined) - likely travel/lodging
- Libertad had COGS > Revenue (underpriced)
- Vista Winds had reasonable COGS but $40K in expenses killed margin

**Key Finding:** Out-of-state work appears structurally unprofitable for LaBrant due to:
1. Travel/lodging expenses eating into margins
2. Inability to leverage local crew efficiency
3. Less control over project conditions
4. Cardinal Capital relationship still valuable - just for Wisconsin work

**Recommendation:** Establish policy to decline Arizona/out-of-state work unless pricing includes 15%+ premium to cover travel overhead and risk.

---

### Hyatt Milwaukee Projects (-$50K Combined Loss)
| Job | GC/Owner | Revenue | Net Income | Net % |
|-----|----------|---------|------------|-------|
| Hyatt Lobby | Peridot CM | $46,519 | $30,195 | **65%** ✅ |
| Hyatt Regency Ballrooms | Peridot CM | $62,096 | -$40,171 | **-65%** ❌ |
| Hyatt Regency Exterior | CL1 Properties | $141,778 | -$40,252 | **-28%** ❌ |
| **Total** | | **$250,393** | **-$50,228** | **-20%** |

**Analysis:**
- Same property (Hyatt Regency Milwaukee), three separate scopes
- Lobby work was highly profitable
- Ballrooms and Exterior both lost ~$40K each
- CL1 Properties appears to be the owner/developer entity

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Large renovation scopes at existing hotels may have hidden conditions
- Exterior work had additional $7,649 in expenses
- Working around hotel operations adds complexity/cost

**Recommendation:** For hotel renovation work:
1. Include discovery/conditions allowance in pricing
2. Premium pricing for work around active hotel operations
3. Clear scope boundaries and change order process
