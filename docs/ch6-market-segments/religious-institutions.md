## Parish Maintenance Market

### Typical Parish Facility Components

Each parish typically includes:
- **Church building** (sanctuary, nave, vestibule)
- **Rectory** (priest residence)
- **Parish hall/gymnasium**
- **School building** (if applicable - ~85 elementary schools)
- **Convent** (if applicable - increasingly repurposed)
- **Administrative offices**
- **Parking structures/lots**

### Painting Maintenance Cycles

| Area | Typical Cycle | Budget Range |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Church interior | 10-15 years | $30,000-$150,000 |
| Church exterior | 8-12 years | $20,000-$75,000 |
| Rectory interior | 7-10 years | $5,000-$15,000 |
| Parish hall | 7-10 years | $10,000-$30,000 |
| School classrooms | 5-7 years | $15,000-$50,000 |
| School common areas | 7-10 years | $10,000-$25,000 |

### Annual Market Size Estimate

**Conservative Calculation:**
- 200 parishes × average $15,000/year maintenance = **$3M annual market**
- Plus major renovations (5-10 parishes/year × $50,000 average) = **$250K-$500K**
- **Total Addressable Market: $3-4M annually**

---

## Lead Certification Advantage

### Why This Matters

**Building Age Distribution (Estimate):**
- Pre-1900: ~20% of churches (historic downtown parishes)
- 1900-1950: ~40% of churches (immigrant-era construction)
- 1950-1978: ~30% of churches (suburban expansion)
- Post-1978: ~10% of churches (recent construction)

**Result:** ~90% of Catholic churches may contain lead paint

### Wisconsin DHS Lead Certification Requirements

For renovation/painting work on pre-1978 buildings:
- Certified renovator required
- Lead-safe work practices mandatory
- Proper containment and cleanup
- Documentation requirements

**LaBrant Advantage:** DHS Lead Certification creates barrier to entry for uncertified competitors.

### Marketing the Lead Advantage

**To Parish Administrators:**
> "As a Wisconsin DHS certified lead contractor, we ensure your renovation project complies with EPA and state regulations while protecting parishioners, students, and staff from lead exposure risks. This is especially important for your historic buildings."

## Scheduling Considerations

### Parish Calendar

|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Advent/Christmas** (Dec) | High activity | AVOID |

| **Lent** (Feb-Apr) | Moderate activity | Limited |
| **Holy Week/Easter** | High activity | AVOID |
| **May** | First Communions, weddings | Limited |
| **June-August** | Summer (fewer Masses) | **BEST for schools** |
