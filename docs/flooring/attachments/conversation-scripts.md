# Conversation Scripts

## MSP Conversation Framework

**Objective:** Secure agreement to add flooring scope to upcoming MSP painting contracts.

**Approach:** Position as scope expansion benefiting MSP (single sub for two trades) rather than LaBrant experiment.

### Talking Points

1. "We're building out integrated Division 9 capabilities—painting and flooring under one sub."

2. "For your projects, this means one contract, one schedule coordination, one punch list."

3. "We'd like to pilot this on [specific project] if you're open to it."

4. "Our pricing will be competitive with market—we're not asking for a premium."

5. "If it doesn't work out, no hard feelings—we'll stick to painting."

### Anticipated Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "You've never done flooring" | "Correct—that's why we want to start with you. You'll give us honest feedback." |
| "I already have a flooring sub" | "Understood. If there's ever a project where single-source makes sense, keep us in mind." |
| "What if you mess it up?" | "We'll warranty our work. And frankly, we're not going to risk our painting relationship with you over flooring." |

## Accountability Conversation Script (Burned GCs)

### Opening

> "Thanks for meeting with me. I wanted to address what happened on [project] directly, because I know it affected how you see LaBrant."

### Acknowledgment

> "We had execution problems. I'm not going to make excuses—the work didn't meet the standard you expected, and that's on us."

### Explanation (Brief)

> "We've since traced those issues to an internal problem that's been addressed. I've made significant operational changes—[1-2 specific examples]."

### Request

> "I know words don't rebuild trust. Execution does. If there's ever an opportunity for us to demonstrate where we are now—even something small—we'd welcome it."

### Flooring Mention (Optional, End of Conversation)

> "Separately, we're also expanding into integrated painting and flooring packages. It's something I think could be valuable for your multifamily pipeline. But that's for down the road—first I'd want to rebuild confidence on the painting side."

### Close

> "I appreciate you taking the time. If a bid opportunity comes up where we might be a fit, I hope you'll consider us."

## WHEDA Developer Outreach Script

**For developers LaBrant has NOT worked with before:**

> "Hi [Name], this is Tyler LaBrant with LaBrant & Associates. We're a certified DBE and SBE commercial painting contractor based in Milwaukee. I saw that [project name] received WHEDA funding—congratulations on that award."

> "I'm reaching out because we specialize in multifamily interiors, and our certifications can help your GC meet diversity participation requirements. We've completed work with [MSP/other reference] on similar projects."

> "I'd like to understand your timeline and who you're working with on the GC side, so I can make sure we're positioned when subcontractor selection begins."

### If Flooring Comes Up Naturally

> "We're also building out integrated Division 9 capabilities—painting and flooring together. It's still early for us on the flooring side, but it's something we're developing for 2025-2026 projects."

## GC Pilot Alignment Talking Points

Use verbatim or near-verbatim when aligning with pilot GC partner.

### Why a Pilot?

> "We're expanding flooring in a controlled pilot so we can deliver the same reliability you expect from our painting scope. This first project is about doing it right, not fast."

### Why Acceptance Gates?

> "Flooring failures are usually substrate- or moisture-driven. These gates protect both of us from latent issues that show up months later."

### Why Documentation?

> "If something ever fails, documentation is the difference between a warranty fix and a dispute. This protects your project and your owner."

### What We Will Walk Away From

> "If the space isn't ready, we won't install. That's non-negotiable—because once flooring goes down, responsibility shifts permanently."

### Why You're the Right Partner

> "We're doing this first with partners who value discipline and long-term outcomes, not short-term schedule pressure."

## GC Interview Validation Questions

Add these to MSP and other GC conversations:

### Question 1: Bundling Preference

> "When you award painting and flooring on multifamily, do you prefer: (a) separate specialized subs for each trade, (b) one sub handling both under a single contract, or (c) flexible depending on project? What would it take for you to try option (b) if you haven't before?"

### Question 2: Current Vendor Assessment

> "Do you already have a bundled interiors vendor you default to for flooring? Where are they underperforming?"

### Question 3: Certification Value

> "Would DBE/SBE certification on combined painting + flooring scope help you meet participation requirements more easily?"

## Positioning Language Reference

### Phase 2 Language (Q2 2025)

**Do NOT say:** "We're now a flooring contractor."

**DO say:** "We're expanding our Division 9 capabilities to offer integrated painting and flooring packages. We'd like to understand how you typically scope these trades on your projects."

### Website Positioning

Update to "Division 9 Interior Finishes" rather than "Painting and Flooring Contractor." This reads as strategic evolution of an established company.

**Emphasize:**
- Comprehensive interior finish packages
- Single-source Division 9 coordination
- Streamlined closeout through integrated scope

**Do not issue press releases or make public announcements during Phase 2.**

## Target GCs for Burned Bridge Repair

| GC | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| McShane Construction | Damaged | Fraud-related execution failures |
| Fiduciary Real Estate | Damaged | Requires reintroduction |
| Nicholas & Associates | Damaged | Requires reintroduction |

**Strategic Principle:** Lead with accountability, not capability expansion. Flooring becomes supporting evidence of operational turnaround—not the headline of the reintroduction conversation.
