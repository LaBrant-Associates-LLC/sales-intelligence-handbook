# Market Diversification

_Part of [Chapter 1: Strategy](index.md) — defines when and how LaBrant diversifies work portfolio without diluting the core._

---

## Context

This page assumes the guardrails and tier doctrine established in [Chapter 1: Strategy](index.md). All geographic references follow the 5-tier system defined there; this page enforces, but does not redefine, tiers.

---

## Diversification Thesis

Diversification is a **risk-management and margin-protection mechanism**, not a growth strategy on its own. It exists to smooth cycles, introduce repeat work, and add scopes competitors avoid—**on top of** a stable multifamily foundation.

Diversification does **not** justify footprint expansion, novelty chasing, or relaxing estimating discipline.

---

## Preconditions

No diversification initiative proceeds unless **all** conditions are met.

1. **Multifamily performance is stable.** Crews are loaded, margins are protected, and estimating discipline is intact.

2. **Tier discipline holds (Tiers 1–3 only).** Diversification never justifies Tier 4–5 work except for Tier 4 hospitality when elevated margin thresholds and explicit owner approval are met.

3. **Entry is partner-led, not bid-led.** GC/owner relationships are proven. Classification rules live in [Chapter 2: GC Intelligence](../ch2-gc-intelligence/).

4. **Scope fits existing strengths.** Sequencing control, occupied-space execution, coatings competence, or shutdown readiness must be advantages.

If any precondition fails, diversification is deferred.

---

## Diversification Guardrails

These rules are **mandatory** and enforceable. Exceeding any guardrail requires owner approval and triggers formal review.

1. **Revenue cap.** Diversification segments may not exceed **40% of total revenue** without owner approval.

2. **Concurrent segment cap.** No more than **three** active diversification segments (outside multifamily) at any time.

3. **Estimating bandwidth cap.** No more than **30% of estimating hours** may be allocated to diversification work in any rolling 30-day period.

4. **Segment exit criteria.** A segment is removed from the approved list after **two consecutive quarters** of below-threshold margin or sustained loss rates, pending owner review.

5. **Escalation authority.** **Owner approval** is required to pause, resume, expand, or exit diversification segments.

---

## Approved Segments

These segments are approved for active pursuit. All other segments require owner approval before estimating begins.

### Hospitality Renovations and Refresh

Hospitality fits because tight schedules, occupied environments, and high expectations for clean punchlists reward disciplined execution. Renovation activity is visible in Milwaukee, Madison, Wisconsin Dells, and Green Bay.

**Positioning:** Occupied-facility production painting with night work capability, rapid floor-by-floor turns, zero-surprise scheduling, and scope clarity that protects reopening dates.

**Primary buyers:** Hotel ownership groups, asset managers, facilities directors, renovation GCs using open-shop subcontractors.

**Competitive advantage:** Integrated drywall/paint firms often avoid disruption risk. Union painters can be more expensive for schedule-sensitive work.

**Proof point:** Hyatt Regency exterior repaint demonstrates large-scale occupied-facility credibility.

**Tier guidance:** Primary in Tiers 1–2. Opportunistic in Tier 3. Tier 4 (Wisconsin Dells) considered only when elevated margin thresholds and explicit owner approval are met.

### Senior Living and Assisted Living

Senior living fits because operators value reliability, cleanliness, and resident disruption control. The segment offers a mix of new build and steady repaint/refresh cycles.

**Positioning:** Healthcare-lite standards without healthcare-bid headaches. Containment, odor control, night/weekend scheduling, and multi-phase repaint programs.

**Primary buyers:** Owner/operators, development firms, facility managers, design-build teams.

**Geographic focus:** SE Wisconsin and Fox Valley, where multiple projects are visible.

**Tier guidance:** Primary in Tiers 1–2. Selective in Tier 3 with proven partners.

### Light Industrial and Manufacturing Maintenance

Light industrial fits because it rewards coatings competence, shutdown readiness, and safety program depth. Bundling pressure is lower than new-build commercial work.

**Positioning:** Corrosion control, equipment and structural steel coatings, tank linings, and shutdown/turnaround execution with minimal production disruption.

**Primary buyers:** Plant managers, facility directors, maintenance supervisors, industrial property owners.

**Geographic focus:** Fox Valley manufacturing corridor and I-94 logistics nodes.

**Tier guidance:** Selective in Tiers 2–3 only. Never volume-driven.

### Repeat GC Interior Renovation

Repeat GC interior work fits because known scope patterns reward sequencing discipline and crew continuity. This segment reinforces existing relationships rather than requiring new market entry.

**Positioning:** Reliable interior renovation execution with predictable production rates, minimal rework, and schedule adherence.

**Primary buyers:** Strategic GC partners already classified in [Chapter 2: GC Intelligence](../ch2-gc-intelligence/).

**Tier guidance:** Allowed across Tiers 1–3 when GC performance is proven.

---

## Segments Explicitly De-Prioritized

These segments are not approved for active pursuit. Estimating time should not be allocated without explicit owner approval.

1. **K-12 public schools.** Union-dominated GC landscape and prevailing wage friction.

2. **Data centers.** Major builds operate under PLAs with union labor requirements.

3. **Retail tenant improvement churn.** Low margin, high administrative burden, unpredictable scheduling. Acceptable as filler only, not a diversification pillar.

4. **Out-of-state work.** Violates Wisconsin-only guardrail. Historical margin destruction.

5. **UW System and union-leaning institutional work.** Unless a true carve-out path exists with owner-direct economics.

---

## Competitive Response Patterns

Diversification success depends on how LaBrant responds when competitors apply pressure.

### Volume Undercutting

When competitors bid aggressively to win volume (10–15% below your number), do not chase the price floor. Respond by reframing the opportunity around schedule certainty, QA documentation, change-order discipline, and no-surprises closeout. If margin rules cannot hold, decline.

### Drywall Bundling

When drywall contractors package painting to compress pricing, treat this as structural pressure on new-build interiors. Respond by shifting pursuit toward owner-direct repaints, specialty scopes (coatings, exterior systems, shutdown work), or partnering strategically when drywall is locked and they need a specialist painter.

### Schedule Compression

When competitors underbid schedule-sensitive work or accept compressed timelines without compensation, respond by emphasizing occupied-facility execution capability, documented production rates, and risk transfer. Position LaBrant as the contractor who protects reopening dates. Price schedule risk explicitly or walk.

### One-Off Specials

When opportunities arise outside repeat programs, decline unless conversion to program intent is explicit. One-off diversification work without a repeat path violates the thesis.

## Go-to-Market Execution

### 12-Month Plan

1. **Build vertical target lists (Weeks 1–2).** Create four lists: hospitality owners and asset managers, senior living operators and developers, industrial facility managers, and property management firms. Target 25–40 prospects per list with named decision-makers.

2. **Create capability packages (Week 3).** Develop three one-pagers: occupied-facility repaint and renovation, industrial coatings and shutdown work, and exterior access and envelope coatings.

3. **Run 90-day outreach sprints (ongoing).** Execute weekly cadence: 15 warm touches, 10 cold touches, 3 in-person site walks. Convert to site walk → budget number → scoped proposal.

4. **Protect the base (ongoing).** Bid gate all multifamily work. Pursue only where LaBrant can win by schedule certainty, QA, and relationship—not lowest number. Reserve 10–15% capacity for higher-margin repaint and renovation work.

5. **Convert pilots to programs.** Any diversification pilot that does not convert to a repeat program or maintenance agreement within 12 months is exited.

### 5-Year Roadmap

**Years 1–2: Second lane without breaking ops.** Add repeat accounts in hospitality, senior living, and industrial maintenance. Build templates: estimate narratives, shutdown playbooks, occupied-work checklists.

**Years 2–3: Second production pod in Madison.** Stand up a small Madison crew or lead (not necessarily an office) once revenue is consistent. Goal: reduce travel friction and win more private Madison work.

**Years 3–5: Statewide repeat accounts.** Land 2–3 statewide owner portfolios (property management, hospitality group, senior living operator). Build maintenance contracts with quarterly or annual repaint cycles.

**Capability investments (selective).** Add access capability (swing stage training and equipment) only if high-rise exteriors become a consistent lane. Traffic marking and striping only after 2–3 profitable pilots.

## Risks

Diversification creates specific risks that must be actively managed.

1. **Estimating dilution.** Diversification spreads estimating focus. Mitigate by limiting to 2–3 new verticals in Year 1 and enforcing the 30% estimating bandwidth cap.

2. **Travel margin destruction.** Distance erodes margin quickly. Mitigate by enforcing tier discipline and requiring Tier 4–5 work to meet elevated margin thresholds.

3. **Union friction surprises.** Bid environment can shift unexpectedly. Mitigate by screening funding source and GC labor posture early in qualification.

4. **Prevailing wage changes.** Wisconsin legislative environment may shift over 5 years. Mitigate by tracking proposed legislation and pricing contingencies into public work.

5. **Core neglect.** Diversification can quietly starve multifamily. Mitigate by monitoring multifamily margin monthly and triggering automatic diversification pause if core performance degrades.

---

## Validation Scenarios

These scenarios test whether diversification is being executed correctly. If expected outcomes are not achieved, investigate precondition failures, guardrail violations, or execution gaps.

1. **Hospitality entry.** Identify 10 target hotels or HOAs in Tiers 1–2. Complete 20 introductions and 6 site walks. Expected outcome: 2 proposals accepted within 90 days, with at least 1 converting to a repeat-cycle agreement.

2. **Senior living entry.** Identify 12 decision-makers at senior living operators or developers. Conduct 4 refresh or new-build bids. Expected outcome: 1 award within 30 days converting to annual maintenance agreement.

3. **Industrial entry.** Identify 15 plants or warehouses in Tiers 2–3. Complete 10 facility manager meetings and 3 shutdown bids. Expected outcome: 1 pilot shutdown job meeting margin threshold with coatings compliance documented.

4. **Repeat GC expansion.** Increase share of interior renovation work with top-tier GCs by 15% year-over-year while maintaining margin at or above threshold.

5. **Diversification overload (failure mode).** If estimating hours on diversification exceed 30% for two consecutive months, or if multifamily margin drops below threshold while diversification is active, diversification must pause pending owner review.
