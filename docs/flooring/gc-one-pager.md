# Flooring Pilot — One‑Page GC Alignment Summary
**LaBrant & Associates LLC**  
**Purpose:** Align expectations for a controlled flooring pilot that protects the project, owner, and GC from latent risk.

---

## Why a Pilot (Not a Full Rollout)
We are introducing flooring through a **single controlled pilot project** to ensure the same reliability and discipline you expect from our painting scope.

This approach:
- Reduces latent flooring risk (moisture, substrate, environment)
- Protects owner warranty position
- Prevents schedule-driven failures that surface months later

This is about **doing it right, not fast**.

---

## What Makes Flooring Different
Unlike paint, most flooring failures:
- Do **not** appear at installation
- Surface **weeks or months later**
- Require **removal and replacement**, not touch-up

That means responsibility must be clearly assigned **before installation**, not after.

---

## Non‑Negotiable Installation Gates
Flooring installation will **not proceed** unless all conditions below are met and documented:

1. **Substrate Acceptance**
   - Flatness and condition reviewed
   - Written GC acceptance on file

2. **Moisture Testing**
   - ASTM method documented
   - Readings within manufacturer limits

3. **Environmental Readiness**
   - HVAC operational
   - Space conditioned ≥48 hours
   - Temperature and RH logged

4. **Material Control**
   - Single dye lot per area
   - Attic stock identified

If any gate fails, installation pauses until resolved.

---

## Daily Documentation Discipline
We apply the same (or higher) discipline used on our painting scope:

- Daily QC report with photos
- Environmental tracking
- Substrate and moisture references
- End‑of‑day protection verification

If it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.

---

## How This Protects the Project
For the **GC**:
- Clear risk transfer and documentation
- Fewer disputes and backcharges
- Cleaner closeout and warranty defense

For the **Owner**:
- Reduced chance of latent flooring failure
- Defensible warranty position

For **All Parties**:
- Facts over opinions if issues arise

---

## What We Will Walk Away From
To protect the project:
- We will not install on unaccepted substrates
- We will not install without HVAC and conditioning
- We will not absorb schedule risk caused by readiness gaps

These controls exist to protect everyone—not to slow the job.

---

## Why We Chose You for the Pilot
We pilot with partners who:
- Value documentation and discipline
- Understand certified / WHEDA / municipal requirements
- Prefer long‑term outcomes over short‑term pressure

Your project is a fit because of that alignment.

---

## Success Criteria
The pilot is successful if:
- Installation completes with zero undocumented deviations
- No moisture or substrate failures occur
- Documentation supports clean closeout
- The process is repeatable without added friction
