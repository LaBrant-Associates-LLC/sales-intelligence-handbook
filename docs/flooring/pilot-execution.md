# Pilot Execution

[← Back to Flooring Overview](index.md)

---

## Pilot Rule: One Project Only

- One GC partner
- One controlled pilot
- No concurrent flooring projects until post-install review is complete

**Two early projects = doubled exposure before learning.**

### Scaling Rule

> **No second flooring project may start until the first project is reviewed, aged, and closed out.**

Scaling before learning is prohibited.

---

## Mandatory Acceptance Gates (5 Items)

**NO INSTALLATION MAY PROCEED unless ALL items below are satisfied and logged.**

### Gate 1: Substrate Acceptance (GC-Signed)

- Flatness verified (documented tolerance check)
- Cracks, joints, and defects logged
- Written GC acceptance on record

**Form:** QC-007 Substrate Acceptance Form

### Gate 2: Moisture Testing (Documented)

- ASTM test method recorded
- Test locations photographed
- Readings logged with date/time
- Results confirmed within manufacturer limits

### Gate 3: Environmental Readiness

- Temperature 65–85°F logged for ≥48 hours
- Relative humidity logged
- HVAC operational confirmation documented

### Gate 4: Material Control

- Dye lot numbers verified and logged
- Entire install area supplied from single lot
- Attic stock identified and tagged

**Form:** QC-009 Material Acclimation Log

### Gate 5: Scope Lock

- Transitions defined
- Base responsibility confirmed
- Protection responsibility confirmed
- Exclusions documented

**If any item is missing: WALK.**

---

## Stop-Work Triggers

Immediately pause installation if:

- HVAC shuts down or is overridden
- Moisture readings exceed limits
- Substrate damage appears after acceptance
- Other trades damage completed flooring
- GC requests scope beyond documented agreement

**Escalate to PM + Owner BEFORE proceeding.**

---

## Walk-Away Authority

| Role | Authority |
|------|-----------|
| **Superintendent** | Full stop-work authority for any precondition failure |
| **Lead Installer** | Authority to halt and escalate to Superintendent |
| **PM** | Authority to resume after corrective action |
| **Owner** | Override authority for edge cases only |

**Walking away is strength, not failure. Schedule pressure does not override precondition requirements.**

---

## QC-001 Integration

Flooring does **not** get a parallel QC system. It lives inside **QC-001, QC-002, QC-004/005, and QA-008 (First Floor Gate).**

### Daily Report MUST Include

- Ambient temperature and RH (AM + PM)
- Moisture test references (if applicable that day)
- Area installed (SF/LF)
- Installer names
- Material batch/lot used
- Protection installed at end of day
- Photos (before, during, after)

**No report = no work credit.**

### Internal Enforcement Rule

- No QC-001 → No earned value
- No photos → No acceptance
- No acceptance → No install

---

## Required Photo Sets

| Set | Content |
|-----|---------|
| **A — Pre-Install** | Substrate condition, flatness check, moisture test, HVAC running |
| **B — In-Progress** | Active installation, dye lot packaging, adhesive/click engagement |
| **C — End of Day** | Completed area, protection installed, transitions |
| **D — Exceptions** | Any deviation, damage, or stop-work condition |

### Photo Naming Convention

## First Floor Gate (QA-008) Flooring Criteria

When flooring scope is active, QA-008 v2.1 includes flooring-specific criteria.

### All Must PASS

- Moisture tests compliant
- Substrate acceptance documented
- Environmental logs clean
- Dye lot control verified
- Acclimation documentation complete
- Zero undocumented scope deviations

**Any FAIL = STOP & DIAGNOSE (Owner approval required to continue).**

---

## Pilot GC Selection Criteria

### Choose a GC Partner Who:

- Has prior relationship trust
- Understands certified payroll / WHEDA / municipal requirements
- Accepts formal acceptance gates
- Does not "solve schedule problems by pushing risk downstream"
- Values documentation over speed

### Do NOT Pilot With a GC Known For:

- Schedule bullying
- Casual verbal directives
- Back-charging without documentation
- Scope creep normalization

### Current Recommendation

**MSP Real Estate** is the only current relationship with sufficient trust to serve as a beta partner for flooring validation.

**Why MSP?**
- Strong relationship, high trust, validated execution
- Will provide honest feedback
- Will tolerate minor execution issues during learning curve
- Will advocate for you to their project teams

---

## Success Criteria for Pilot Completion

The pilot is considered successful only if:

- Installation completes with zero undocumented deviations
- No moisture or substrate-related callbacks occur
- GC feedback confirms reduced friction (not increased)
- Internal PMs demonstrate comfort enforcing gates
- Post-install review identifies refinements before scaling

## Final Reminder

This expansion succeeds **only** if:

- Discipline is enforced even when uncomfortable
- Walking away is viewed as strength, not failure
- Process integrity outranks revenue urgency

**The strategy is sound. Execution discipline keeps it alive.**
