## Key Facts to Remember

1. **Fire hydrant painting is NOT a municipal opportunity.** 20 of 21 water utilities do this work in-house. Only Oconomowoc contracts out.

2. **Data centers are 100% inaccessible.** Despite $25B+ Wisconsin investment, all projects use union PLAs.

3. **County jails have minimal new construction.** Focus on maintenance painting through facilities management instead.

4. **WisDOT bridge painting is embedded** in larger rehabilitation contracts. Pursue through Mashuda Contractors: DBE@mashuda.com
