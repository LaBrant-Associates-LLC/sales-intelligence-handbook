## Market Opportunity Summary

**Estimated Annual Painting Volume (SE Wisconsin Senior Living):**

| Segment | Facilities | Est. Annual Spend |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Large Campus Operators (Capri, St. Camillus, Saint John's) | 15-20 | $300K-500K |
| Medium Operators (Ovation, Brookdale regional, Three Pillars) | 10-15 | $150K-250K |
| Smaller CBRFs/ALs (Adava, others) | 30-50 | $100K-200K |
| **TOTAL** | **55-85** | **$550K-950K** |

**Why Senior Living is Tier 1 Opportunity:**

1. **Merit-shop GC alignment** -- Moore, McShane, VJS, Stevens, Greenfire build senior living projects
2. **Private ownership** -- Not subject to prevailing wage or union labor requirements
3. **Recurring revenue** -- Unit turnovers and common area refresh create predictable annual demand
4. **Lead certification value** -- Many older buildings require lead-certified contractors
5. **Relationship-driven** -- Once established, facility maintenance contracts tend to be sticky
