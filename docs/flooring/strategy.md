# Strategy & Rationale

[← Back to Flooring Overview](index.md)

## Why Flooring Expansion

Flooring expansion is **not** a strategy risk. It is an **execution-discipline risk**.

This expansion leverages significant operational overlap with existing painting capabilities. Both trades fall under CSI Division 9 (Finishes), share environmental requirements, follow similar quality control documentation practices, and serve the same GC relationships.

**Core Strategic Principle:** Lead with accountability, not capability expansion. Flooring becomes supporting evidence of operational turnaround—not the headline of the reintroduction conversation.

Unlike painting, flooring failures are:

- **Latent** — often appear weeks or months later
- **Binary** — repair vs. full replacement
- **Highly visible** — to owners and lenders

This chapter exists to prevent early failure from process drift, not technical incompetence.

## Market Gap Statement

Deep competitive research reveals the SE Wisconsin flooring subcontractor market is fragmented with no dominant non-union player specializing in multifamily.

| Competitor | Why Not Direct Competition |
|------------|---------------------------|
| QBC | Carpentry + flooring, NO painting |
| Suburban Drywall | Drywall + painting, NO flooring |
| Thomas A. Mason | Painting + flooring, UNION ONLY |
| IOC Construction | Painting + flooring, CHICAGO BASED (90 miles) |
| K2/Lakeside | Painting + epoxy only (not apartment LVP/carpet) |
| FLOOR360 | Flooring only, NO painting, NO certifications |

**Key Finding:** Only one regional competitor—IOC Construction (Chicago-based)—currently offers painting + flooring as a package for multifamily. Thomas A. Mason, Wisconsin's largest painting contractor, offers flooring but operates union-only and focuses on institutional work rather than multifamily apartments.

**No Milwaukee-based merit-shop contractor currently bundles painting + flooring together. This gap represents LaBrant's market entry opportunity.**

## Scope Bundling Patterns in Wisconsin

Research identified four distinct patterns of how flooring is bundled with other trades:

**Pattern 1: Carpentry + Flooring (QBC Model)**
QBC bundles rough carpentry, finish carpentry, cabinetry, countertops, and flooring under one contract. They explicitly do NOT paint. Key clients include Stevens Construction, Forward Management, and McGann Construction.

**Pattern 2: Drywall + Painting (Suburban Model)**
Suburban Drywall bundles drywall, insulation, metal framing, and painting. They explicitly do NOT do flooring. Revenue: $47.7M.

**Pattern 3: Painting + Flooring (Union Model)**
Thomas A. Mason bundles painting and flooring but operates UNION ONLY. Focus is institutional work (Milwaukee City Hall, airports), not private multifamily.

**Pattern 4: Turnkey Property Renovation**
IOC Construction (Chicago) bundles roofing, painting, flooring, siding, and construction services. They target property managers and multifamily, but are 90 miles from Milwaukee with no local presence.

**Strategic Implication:** The gap between these patterns is where LaBrant fits—painting + flooring for merit-shop multifamily new construction.

## Certification Stacking Value Proposition

Combining painting + flooring under one DBE/SBE contractor creates multiplicative value for GCs on diversity-focused projects.

### Example: 100-Unit WHEDA Project in Milwaukee

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total construction cost | $25 million |
| 25% SBE participation goal | $6.25 million required |
| LaBrant painting-only bid | $300,000 (counts toward goal) |
| LaBrant painting+flooring bid | $650,000 (counts toward goal) |

**Value to GC:** By awarding both trades to LaBrant, the GC gets $650,000 toward their $6.25M goal from a single subcontractor relationship instead of managing two separate certified subs.

### Certification Leverage by Project Type

| Project Type | Certification Advantage |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Milwaukee City | 25% SBE goal + 10% bid preference on combined scope |
| Milwaukee County | 25% TBE goal (DBE = TBE recognition) |
| WHEDA-Funded | Diversity requirements on all HTC projects |
| RPP Projects | Combined scope = more Milwaukee resident workforce hours |

On virtually every accessible WHEDA project, LaBrant's certifications create competitive advantage. Adding flooring doubles the dollar value that counts toward GC participation goals.

## Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

### Phase 1 Thresholds (End of Q1 2025)

| Criterion | Threshold | Decision |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| First project margin | ≥20% | Continue |
| MSP feedback | "Would use again" | Continue |
| Crew execution quality | No callbacks | Continue |
| Cost variance vs. estimate | ≤15% | Continue |

**If any criterion fails:** Pause Phase 2, address root cause, repeat validation project.

### Decision Calendar

| Date | Decision Point | Criteria |
|------|----------------|----------|
| March 31, 2025 | Phase 1 Go/No-Go | See criteria above |
| June 30, 2025 | Phase 2 Complete | 3 projects, 1 reference |
| September 30, 2025 | Key Hire Decision | Volume triggers met |
| December 31, 2025 | FY 2026 Readiness | 5 projects, validated pricing |

## Research Gaps (Critical)

Before the first bid, these gaps must be addressed:

1. **Which flooring subs are bidding your GC projects?** — The single most important intelligence gap
2. **BYCO certification verification** — Claims MBE/SBE/DBE, not independently verified
3. **Insurance cost differential** — Need actual quote for NCCI 5437 flooring classification
4. **GC estimator validation** — Confirm preference for bundled Division 9 scope
